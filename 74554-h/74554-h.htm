  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>The scourge of the social evil and its
baneful and disintegrating influences
on the moral and physical structure
of modern society has come to be recognized
more and more by the public opinion
as one of the most burning social problems
of to-day. A new battle cry of social purity
and conservation of manhood and womanhood
has resounded on the battlefield of
social endeavor, and a new crusade, under
the banner of a young but vigorous movement
of eugenics, has been started for a
morally pure and physically strong young
generation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most effective method of waging this
campaign against evil forces of vice and
moral contamination would be to start an
aggressive movement in two different directions
of social endeavor. One is the campaign
of social legislation and reforms for
the purpose of eradicating deeply-lying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>causes of economic, social, or political character,
which originate and foster various
manifestations and forms of the social evil,
to change gradually the underground from
which all evil forces are arising, and to raise
the moral tone of society as a whole.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other way is to attack the monster
of social evil by reaching the individual offender
and by protecting him from the pitfalls
and dangers, through moral persuasion
and by arming him with the necessary
knowledge of sex life in health and disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is agreed on all sides that the
keynote of this educational movement
should be a campaign of sex education and
moral prophylaxis. The young generation,
both boys and girls alike, should be taught
from an early age the proper biological and
social function of sex, and trained in an
open and healthy attitude toward sex problems.
The prudish and hypocritical attitude
of society is universally regarded as
the main cause of all-pervading diffusion of
the social evil, furthered by a most flagrant
ignorance on one hand and a morbid curiosity
produced by this attitude on the other.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>A discussion as to which weapon at our
command in this propaganda should be considered
most effective, and which particular
of the stock arguments commonly used in
the campaign for sexual morality is to be
preferred, seems to the writer perfectly irrelevant
and non-essential. Whether we
appeal to the nobler and higher instincts of
manhood, or to the reason and intelligence
of the man by enlightening him on the
biological function and significance of sex,
or try to instill the fear of the evil consequences
of sexual transgression, none of
these arguments should be emphasized
more than another, but all should be presented
with equal force and emphasis. The
degree of influence which any of these
motives, single or combined, may exert on
a man varies not only with the different
type of man, but even in the same individual
the force of these appeals will vary in different
moods and under different circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>One essential condition for the success
and effectiveness of the propaganda of sexual
hygiene and morality is a concrete, practical,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>and natural presentation of the subject,
without abstract theorizing or ill-disguised
sermonizing, which bores and rather
repels an unsophisticated and untrained in
intellectual reasoning average street man or
boy—the real would-be beneficiaries of this
crusade.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is the writer’s firm conviction, based
on many years of genito-urinary practice
and mingling with men and boys of different
classes, that each one of them is only
too eager for sex knowledge; but this knowledge
has to be presented in a concrete,
matter-of-fact fashion, comprising and explaining
various problems and facts of
sexual life in health and disease as they
arise daily in the life of the average man or
boy. In this way, and in this way only, in
the writer’s opinion, a man of the masses
can be reached.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c006'>No greater and more sacred ambition
can stir the heart of a boy or youth
than to grow up into a perfect
manhood, to become strong enough physically
and mentally to meet any demands
on his strength that life may put upon him.
Equally so, no more important nor more
sacred duty lies on a grown-up, fully developed
man than to keep this treasure of
physical and mental equipment bestowed
upon him by generous Nature intact and
unimpaired.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unfortunately, while most men and boys
have good intentions and right ambitions,
many of them, by weakness of character,
light-mindedness, but mostly thru ignorance,
yield to evil temptations, to ugly and
morbid habits, to self-destructive practices,
only to find themselves, after a few years
of “sowing wild oats,” as “damaged goods,”
physical and mental wrecks, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>strength or ambition to live, worn out and
sapped by chronic diseases. It can be truly
said that no other scourge blights as many
happy homes, destroys as many brilliant
careers, undermines as much vitality of
body and spirit as does abuse of the sexual
system. If it were possible to express in
figures and money value the total amount
of loss of money, time, physical suffering,
mental anguish, blighted happiness, and
permanent invalidism; if it were possible to
summarize all the misery and suffering, all
the decay and waste of human bodies and
souls, caused directly or indirectly by diseases
of sexual origin, the world would be
staggered and shocked by the immense sacrifice
it brings to the Moloch of sex ignorance.</p>

<p class='c007'>What does sex mean to the average
man and youth? What idea does he have
of the function of sex in the human body
and its significance in human life? To a
youth, sex means a mysterious force that
makes itself felt by vague desires and impulses,
by an irresistible attraction toward
the opposite sex, by its undefinable impulses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>in his whole being—his body, his mind, his
feelings. But before he has time to clear
up the mystery of his body, some companions
more experienced in life’s vulgarities
initiate him almost by force in the
physical mysteries of the sexual relationship,
ordinarily under the most vicious and
vile surroundings, which initiation leaves
in him invariably a lasting and intense aftertaste
of shame and disgust. More sensitive
and refined natures instinctively recoil after
this harrowing experience, and exert their
best and sincerest efforts to avoid temptations
and keep their bodies and feelings
fresh and clean. Others yield again to the
stronger will of the older debased companions,
and gradually develop a habit of
indulgence in brutal and degrading passions,
with the subsequent train of venereal
diseases, impairment of physical and mental
strength, and gradual withering of all
moral noble features of manly character.
And yet under proper instructions and the
right attitude of mind, no man or boy should
fail to realize that sex is the most precious
treasure he possesses, the squandering and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>abuse of which is sheer madness and self-destruction.</p>

<p class='c007'>Think of a boy fourteen to sixteen years
old on the threshold of manhood, and watch
the changes going on in his whole being at
this period of transition. Watch this most
wonderful transformation, how a frail, little,
helpless skeleton shoots into a large-boned
frame with powerful muscles; how his
squealing, girlish voice deepens into a low,
manly, vibrating tone, and the smooth skin
of the face and genital organs begins to show
a hairy growth. Equally great changes take
place in the boy’s mentality and feelings.
A childish helplessness and insecurity gives
place to self-assurance and assertiveness,
coming from the inner feeling of growing
power and ability to protect himself. Childish,
care-free, everlasting joy gives way to
a new feeling of growing responsibilities and
duties, to plans and ambitions to strive for
glory and success in life. The feeling of
inner force and energy stirs him to ever-new
activities, spurs him to ever-new
achievements. Nothing is too hard for a
youth standing on the threshold of manhood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>no job is too big for him, no ambition
is too high to realize. This is the time when
the character and personality of a boy assume
their permanent shape that forecasts
the success or failure of his whole future
life. And then comes the last and crowning
change in growing manhood. He begins to
feel an indefinite longing, vague and dreamy
romantic impulses, and rapid changes of
mood begin to disturb his repose. A new
attitude toward the opposite sex gradually
makes itself felt, and a woman acquires in
his mind and feelings a new meaning and a
new light. Womanly beauty and perfection,
of which he has been unaware and
unconscious, begins to exert on him all-powerful
and irresistible attraction, and
with further bodily and mental growth, he
gradually reaches full maturity and enters
the stage of highest consummation of normal
manhood—love, marriage, and happy
family life.</p>

<p class='c007'>What magic power has brought about
these changes from a helpless child to a
strong, able-bodied man, ready for an active
and happy life? This wonderful power is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>sex. Sex is the magic source of life, which
not only reproduces life, but also keeps up
the divine spark of vitality in the human
body and controls and stimulates its growth
and healthy development. <i>Sexual glands
that every healthy child gets from its very inception,
thru their internal secretions, act as a
source of life and energy in the body, stimulating
its growth and influencing its general
condition.</i> And just as killing frost or
withering heat stunts and dwarfs a young
plant, so any abuse or lack of care of the
sexual system will dwarf and stunt the
growing boy, physically, mentally, and
morally.</p>

<p class='c007'>But even after a man has reached a full
state of physical development, his sexual
system exerts the same all-powerful influence
over his body and mind. His own
health and happiness, as well as the happiness
of his wife and children, are most intimately
and deeply dependent on the
healthy and normal condition of his sexual
system.</p>

<p class='c007'>So it can readily be seen that sex is the
greatest treasure Nature has bestowed upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>men, and that the sexual organs are just as
important for health and happiness as are
any other organs of the body. For this
reason every boy and man should know
how to take care of these most vital organs
in health and disease. In a word, he should
have all necessary knowledge to protect and
to keep intact his priceless heritage—healthy
and noble manhood.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>Anatomy and Physiology (Structure and Function) of the Male Generative Organs</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>To get a clear idea of the sexual system
of a man, it is necessary first to learn the
structure and function of sexual organs; that
is, to get a brief acquaintance with their
anatomy and physiology.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is just the very purpose of this
book, to give to intelligent and self-conscious
boys and men this necessary knowledge,
to give them guidance and information,
which they need on different occasions,
to solve and clear up their many
doubts and questions that come up in the
intimate recesses of their minds and which
arise on different experiences of sexual life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sexual system of a man consists of
the <i>penis</i>, two <i>testicles</i> with two <i>seminal
ducts</i>, two <i>seminal vesicles</i>, and one <i>prostate
gland</i>. The <i>penis</i> is a composite structure,
as it has a double function of sexual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>and urinary organ. It consists of <i>three
cavernous, erectile elastic bodies</i> capped in
front by a head part—two of them on the
sides and one underneath. These bodies
contain numerous spaces, collapsible in the
time of quiescence, but in time of sexual
excitement, in the state of <i>erection</i>, those
spaces fill up with blood and render the
penis turgid and hard. Underneath the
side cavernous bodies, piercing thru the
lower cavernous body, goes the <i>urethral
canal</i>, which starts from the bladder and
reaches the external opening. The <i>urethra</i>
has a double function: it carries urine from
the bladder out of the body and it serves
as a carrier for natural sexual secretions.
The <i>testicles</i> are the most important sexual
glands, as they produce human living cells—embryos—so-called
<i>spermatozoa</i>. The
testicles, two in number, are pigeon egg
sized bodies, suspended by the spermatic
cord in a sac called the scrotum.</p>

<p class='c007'>The natural seminal secretion, semen,
or <i>sperma</i>, after its production in the
testicle, is carried out thru a <i>long seminal
duct</i>, which, when unraveled, measures
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>about twenty feet long, but in a natural
condition is twisted and folded on itself
many hundred times, forming a bundle-like
swelling in the back of the testicle—<i>epididymis</i>.
This detail is good to remember,
as epididymis plays a very important part
in venereal diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The seminal duct goes thru the spermatic
cord a long way and passes thru the <i>inguinal</i>
canal, located in the groin and enters the
seminal vesicles, which are located in the rear
of the base of the urinary bladder. The
<i>seminal vesicles</i> are the reservoir tanks for the
<i>seminal fluid</i>, which resemble small pouch
pockets, where it is stored up and accumulated
before it is <i>ejected thru the ejaculatory
duct</i> into the deep part of the urethral canal
and then carried outward, spontaneously in
a <i>wet dream</i> or actively in sexual intercourse.
The seminal vesicles also produce their
own viscid fluid-secretion, which probably
preserves the spermatozoa in time of storage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The <i>spermatic cord</i> serves as a cable
connecting the testicles with the rest of the
body, and contains the <i>seminal duct</i>, nerves,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and blood vessels that give vitality and
blood supply to the testicles.</p>

<p class='c007'>Last, but not least in importance among
organs of the male sexual system, is the
<i>Prostatic Gland</i>. The prostatic gland resembles
in form a chestnut, and is located
deep under the urinary bladder, right between
the seminal vesicles. This gland is
very rich in muscles, which surround the
deep part of the urethral canal, where it
starts from the bladder, and takes an active
part in closing up and opening the bladder
in time of urination. The Prostate Gland is
also very rich in nerves, which connect it
with almost every part of the body. For
this reason, as will be seen in the chapter
on sexual diseases, the healthy condition of
the Prostate Gland is absolutely necessary
for a normal and happy life. The Prostate
Gland also produces a very important sexual
secretion well familiar to all—a grayish
white milky emulsion with characteristic
sweetish odor and alkaline reaction. This
secretion is very important, as it preserves
and stimulates the vitality of the <i>sperma</i><i>tozoa</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>before they reach the female embryo
<i>ovum</i> for the purpose of <i>fertilization</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it can be seen that the <i>seminal
secretion</i> a man loses, either during a wet
dream or in sexual intercourse, is not a
simple, but a composite fluid, consisting of
secretions of the testicles, prostatic gland,
seminal vesicles, and also numerous mucous
glands of the urethral canal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most important element of the seminal
fluid is the secretion produced by the
testicles and containing spermatozoa. <i>Spermatozoa</i>,
or human embryos, are microscopically
small living cells, which resemble
very much in appearance tadpoles. They
consist of a pear-like head, thread-like
tapering neck and tail, and thousands of
them can be seen in a drop of sperma under
a microscope, as rapidly moving and swarming
around little worms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us consider now briefly the function
of sexual organs. The structure and mutual
adjustment of the parts in time of function
clearly indicate that the main purpose and
vital function intended by Nature for these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>organs is procreation and transmission of
life. Every single organ of the sexual system
is constructed and provided with wonderful
creative power and natural appliances,
all to one purpose—to preserve and
to facilitate the transmission of the living
spermatozoa to a meeting place of its mate
of fertilization and conception—the female
embryo—ovum. This is the reason why
sexual organs are also called <i>generative</i> organs.
This must also be the reason why
Nature has timed the awakening of the
sexual impulse with the period of the greatest
development of all the faculties of the
human body and mind, so as to render a
man mature and prepared to shoulder the
heavy responsibilities of husband and father.
Unfortunately, under modern economic and
social conditions the physical and mental
maturity does not coincide with the <i>economic</i>
and social readiness to take up the
obligations of family life, and marriage is
often forcibly deferred to many years after
the physical age of maturity. This brings
under discussion the most important practical
question of sex continence.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>
  <h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Sexual Continence</span>.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The question whether sexual relationship
is a natural necessity and whether
a man can abstain from sexual indulgence
and remain in perfect health is commonly
debated in bachelors’ quarters, and seems
to have been decided by popular opinion
in the negative. But a glance at the scientific
bases of this problem and every-day
experience of every unbiased man is
sufficient to show that nothing could be
further from the truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sex is a <i>biological</i>, not a <i>physical</i> function;
that is, the evacuation of the seminal
fluid out of the body is intended by Nature
for the purpose of fertilization only, and is
not necessary for the physical well-being of
the individual. The general stimulating
and vitalizing effect of the internal secretions
of the sexual glands is best obtained
and subserved by retaining these fluids in
the body; that is, by abstaining from free
sexual intercourse. That this is so can be
readily substantiated by practical observation;
whenever a man undertakes to perform
some mental or physical task, he has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>to lead an abstinent and moderate life to
get out the maximum of his efficiency.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Pollution</span> (<i>Night Emission—Wet Dream</i>).</h3>

<p class='c015'>Nature has wisely provided man with a
wonderful self-regulating appliance, which
fact explodes the popular belief about danger
to health in overaccumulation of the
seminal secretions in the body. Whenever
such accumulation of the seminal fluid takes
place in a healthy man, and he begins to
feel a certain nervous tension and blood-flushes,
Nature opens her safety valve and
the overdistended seminal vesicles by pressure
bring in motion the nervous muscular
apparatus of the sexual organs, and this
accumulated surplus comes out at night in
sleep as a “wet dream” night emission,
medically called “pollution.” The best
proof that this phenomenon is normal,
natural, and purposeful can be seen in the
fact that the morning after it the man loses
all the disturbing sensations of nervous
tension and at once regains his freshness
and vigor. <i>A man may have these emissions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>once or twice a month, even once a week, and
he does not have to worry about it in the least</i>,
provided that after each night emission he
feels fresher and more vigorous than before
it.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Controlling Factors of Sexual Instinct.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>In discussing sexual abstinence and its
possible injurious effect on health, some
very important facts bearing on the question
should be brought out.</p>

<p class='c007'>First, the popular idea that sex is as
much a physical necessity as are other instincts
of self-preservation, such as hunger,
thirst, or sleep, is fundamentally wrong.
Hunger, thirst, etc., are imperative at all
ages and under all circumstances. The lack
of their satisfaction for a very few days
leads to wasting, destruction of the body,
and physical suffering. The sexual impulse
awakens only at a certain age, lasts a
certain period of time, and gradually goes
down, leaving the physical welfare of the
body undisturbed.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Individual Variations.</i>—Another extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>important difference is that hunger,
thirst, sleep, and other bodily instincts
are implanted in every human being, and
individual natural differences in regard to
these instincts are so insignificant as to be
negligible. (We wish to emphasize the
word “natural” in its true sense, as in
actual life many people develop so many
different habits as to the quality and quantity
of food and drink and in their ignorance
call them their “nature.”) How different
it is with the sex function. People are
so different as to their sexual capacity and
preferences, commonly called “temperament,”
that no hard or fast rules can be
enjoined on the average man or woman, and
not even approximate limits can be given
in an individual case. There are many so-called
<i>frigid</i> natures, particularly among
women, who feel not the slightest attraction
for the members of the opposite sex,
and are able to go for years and even thruout
life without any active desire for sexual
relationship. On the other hand, there are
some individuals who, either thru heredity
or thru personal unbridled indulgence, are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>so obsessed by sexual passion that their
mind remains shut off to every refined and
moral influence, and they turn into low,
beastly slaves of their brutal passions.
What is sexually exciting and attractive to
one man, leaves another man perfectly indifferent,
and may be disgusting and repulsive
to a third. Surely an instinct that
is so changeable and so widely differs with
different people is not a physical necessity
of our body, and can be held in abeyance
for a long period of time.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Psychology of Sex.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>It has been pointed out above that besides
its primary and main biological function
of the transmission of life, sex also has
a powerful stimulating and vitalizing influence
on the development of the individual,
which is particularly conspicuous in time of
adolescence and approaching puberty. But
the influence of sex is not only limited to
the physical sphere; in fact, its influence on
the psychology and mentality of the individual
is equally powerful, far-reaching, and
lasting thru the greater part of life. Sex
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>unquestionably is the greatest emotional
power in human life, the greatest and
strongest single factor controlling human
feelings and emotions. From a mere physical
animal instinct of procreation as it is
manifested in the animal world, in the man
Nature has transformed and has exalted
sex into the highest all-pervading function
of human life, has spiritualized and beautified
this physical impulse into a most ennobling
and ecstatic passion of the human
soul—the passion of love.</p>

<p class='c007'>Love between a man and woman and
its consummation in marriage and formation
of the unit, the family, is the highest
expression and development of the primitive
sex instinct; it is the only form of expression
of the sexual impulse intended by
Nature and sanctioned by religion and the
social code of morals. Sex, in its spiritualized
and purified form of love, has ever
been the dominating and controlling factor
in the history of the human race. Love
has furnished more to the content of the
emotional life of human kind than any
other emotional force. Love has been at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>all times the source of inspiration to the
greatest creative geniuses of all arts, be
it music, literature, drama, pictures, etc.
Nothing thrills an average man or woman
as much, nothing strikes a vibrating response
of a human heart as quickly as an
artistically presented romance of love. The
only instinct that rivals in intensity the
love between man and woman is mother’s
love, which is also based on the sex impulse,
tho of a wider import. Mother love
is, as it were, a continuation of the biological
function of sex, a Nature’s provision
to protect and to raise the offspring begotten
in love.</p>

<p class='c007'>The power of sex for good or evil in
human life is unlimited. A spiritualized sex
impulse—love—ennobles the man and renders
him responsive to the best and highest
sentiments, inspires him to noblest deeds
of devotion and self-sacrifice. The sex impulse,
not exalted by the divine touch of
love, and left unbridled in its primitive
form, becomes a destructive and brutalizing
force, that not only inflicts the physical
punishment of disease and loss of sexual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>power, but also destroys the best and
noblest elements of manhood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact that every man and boy suffering
from a venereal disease or a disorder
resulting from bad sexual habits feels
ashamed, degraded, and deeply disgusted
with himself, is due not only to the fear of
public disgrace and ridicule, but it is essentially
a feeling of guilt against his own
physical and moral self.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides the emotional sphere, <i>sex exerts
an equally far-reaching influence on
the sphere of mentality</i>. The faculties
of intellect and reasoning are not affected
directly by the sexual impulse, but
indirectly the intellectual capacity is greatly
dependent upon sexual characteristics of
the man. A man leading a normal sexual
life, that is, being continent if he is below
the age of full sexual maturity, and, being
married, if he is above the age, commands
the best conditions of intellectual efficiency.
His mind being undisturbed and unshaken
by periodical waves of sexual excitement, of
casual indulgences and nervous exhaustions
following sexual excesses or abuses, remains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>steadily in a state of perfect repose and
continual freshness, which renders him
capable of the greatest mental concentration
and vigorous sustained mental effort.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of a married man, the
state of mental energy and efficiency is
still more increased by a powerful incentive
and stimulation felt by every normal man
to exert his best efforts and to strive to the
best of his ability for the welfare and good
name of his family. Strange as it may seem
to some, the sexual impulse and feeling has
had the greatest influence on the development
of morals and social ethics. The popular
old-time idea that the sexual organs
and feeling are something shameful, disgusting,
and loathsome is based on a gross
ignorance and on a crude, vulgar, and
narrow-minded interpretation of the great
natural provision. Whatever shameful, immoral,
or degrading there may be about
the sexual feeling and function is put into
it by the ignorant, vicious, and vulgar
mental attitude and unclean thoughts of
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Surely the impulse and organs of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>human body, designed by the Great Creator
for the highest function of human life—that
of transmission of life—cannot be
shameful, nor vulgar, nor immoral. The
broad and intelligent interpretation of sex
raises it above a mere animal instinct, ennobles
and purifies it from any element of
low and brutal passions, and by instilling
in the man a feeling of sacredness and
moral obligation on his part towards the
future family, renders the sex problem a
subject worthy of reverence and earnest
study.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Physiological Bases of Sex Impulse.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>For a clear understanding of the natural
mechanism by which a sexual impulse is
originated, set in motion, and brought to
its natural climax—<i>ejaculation</i> (emission of
the seminal fluid)—it is necessary to explain
briefly the nervous apparatus controlling
this sexual function. The main
nervous center directly controlling and
setting in motion every successive step in
the sexual act is located in the lumbar
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>(loin) part of the spinal cord. This is the
center of <i>erection</i>. This center can operate
under certain circumstances spontaneously,
without active control of the will or consciousness,
but ordinarily it is under full
and absolute control of the brain centers
forming sexual ideas and impulses. The
center of erection can be stimulated or excited
either by <i>impulses from the sexual
brain center</i>, which is by far the most frequent
way of the two of forming sexual desire,
or it can be stimulated by <i>impulses
from the genital organs</i>. The most common
causes producing erection thru impulses
from the genital organs are: a mechanical
friction or tickling of the genital organs
(intentional, as in self-abuse, or accidental
and spontaneous); irritative influences in
various diseases of the genital organs; pressure
on the nerves by the bladder distended
with urine (particularly on awakening in
the morning); the seminal vesicles overfilled
with seminal fluid, or even the blood congestion
caused by lying on the back. All
these causes, with the exception of a deliberate
masturbation (self-abuse), can produce
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>an erection without active participation of
the consciousness or will power: they belong
to the realm of subconscious acts, but their
intensity never grows sufficiently strong to
bring about a natural resolution of the
sexual reflex thru the ejaculation of the
seminal fluid. The only exception is the
sexual irritation produced by the seminal
vesicles overdistended with secretion; in
this case it comes to a resolution thru a
“wet dream,” or night emission. The very
fact that a <i>healthy, normal man never has
wet dreams in the daytime in a waking state</i>
conclusively shows that under normal circumstances
a natural sexual feeling is
never so intense or imperative as to consider
it as a natural necessity, calling for
gratification. The <i>ordinary active state of
mind and concentration of attention on the
regular pursuits of life is sufficient to keep
vague sexual impulses in the realm of the
subconscious.</i> It is only the active participation
of mind and the concentration of
attention on these impulses that brings
them out on the surface of consciousness.
Once this vague impulse or idea is perceived
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>by the mind as a sexual idea or
emotion, if the will power of the man is not
strong enough to push it back again and to
submerge the impulse in the realm of the
subconscious, the imagination steps in and,
by conjuring up various lascivious and sensual
images and dreams, stimulates and
fans up the flickering light of the original
impulse into a mighty, all-devouring, irresistible
flame of sexual passion, overpowering
all reasoning and self-control of the
man. Once it has yielded and has permitted
the sexual subconscious impulse into
the field of consciousness and attention, the
mind becomes less resistent, more sensitive
and susceptible to all sexual stimulation, the
imagination runs riot, and every sensual
impression is not only not resisted, but
eagerly sought for. The slightest stimulating
impression that leaves a man with
normal acting mind perfectly indifferent and
cold, or even evokes a feeling of disgust,
such as vulgar, indecently-dressed women,
suggestive stories, ribald songs, etc., sets
such a man on fire and renders him a helpless
slave to an animal passion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>And yet how easy it would have been
to stem this tide of passion in the beginning,
just with the slightest effort of will
power, by not allowing these vague impulses
to come into the realm of consciousness,
and by concentrating the attention
on some purposeful occupation or healthy
pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it can be readily seen that the
sexual impulse can never spontaneously intrude
itself into the consciousness of a man,
and that the <i>sexual desire grows in intensity
and becomes overwhelming only with the active
participation of the man’s mind and the connivance
of his will power.</i> This fact is of tremendous
practical importance for the problem
of sexual continence and its solution.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the mind is clean, and the attention
is purposefully occupied, all danger of
temptation and sexual missteps is eliminated.
The <i>main center of the sexual desire
lies in the brain and in the mind, and not in
the body.</i> No “natural physical necessity”
will be felt if one has full control of his
mind. <i>A mere abstinence from the physical
act of sexual intercourse does not make a man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>moral, nor is it physically healthy or worthy of
his great effort of self-control.</i> His mind is
torn asunder by a constant internal struggle
between wildly-running imagination and
will power, his mental repose is disturbed,
his mental or physical efficiency is impaired.
<i>There is only one rational, scientifically correct
effective way to control a sexual instinct;
that is, to control the body by controlling
the mind first.</i> The easiest and most
certain manner of obtaining this control
of the mind is by keeping the mind busy
and engaged by active, purposeful, and
healthy interests. These interests by themselves,
as it were, automatically, will keep
the attention and all the faculties of the
mind engaged, and thus in a natural way,
without any special effort, the sexual impulses
will be kept in the realm of the subconscious,
as inner vague feelings, not interfering
with the man’s comfort and efficiency
nor disturbing his mental repose.</p>

<p class='c007'>These theoretical contentions are fully
borne out by practical observations in regard
to the influence of the mind on the
sexual instinct.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>
  <h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Influence of the Mind on the Sexual Instinct.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Practical experience shows that no other
function of the body is so absolutely controlled
by the nervous system and more dependent
on the state of the mind than the
function of sex. All other instincts and
functions of the body, like hunger, sleep,
digestion, breathing, etc., are controlled to
some extent by mind influences. Different
feelings and emotions, like fright, worry,
sorrow, etc., check and retard all functions
for a while, but they cannot retard them
for a long time, and surely cannot stop
them altogether. How different it is with
the sexual impulse. Different mental states
can not only subdue the sexual impulse for
many, many months, but they can completely
check it for an indefinite period of
time. The every-day experience of any
man will show that when a man’s mind is
occupied by any healthy and normal interest,
when he is absorbed by mental or
physical work, when his energy and attention
are used up in a purposeful and productive
occupation, no lascivious thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>enters his mind, no sexual impulse disturbs
his repose. It is only when the mind is
idle, and the body did not work off its
surplus of energy, that the fancy runs
riot and a man is bent on mischief. Take
one hundred cases, when a man or boy
breaks loose and takes a plunge into the
quagmire of prostitution, analyze the circumstances
and influences that bring about
this misstep, and you will find that in
ninety-nine of these hundred cases the hero
of this adventure is more of a victim than
an active, deliberate perpetrator. Usually
it is first a case of overeating rich, stimulating
food that heats the blood and clouds
clear judgment, the imbibing of sweet wine
or alcoholic liquors still more excites and
intoxicates our hero; heavy smoking adds
its effects to ever-increasing dulling of
intellect and checks the normal feeling of
self-control and discrimination; vulgar jokes
and smutty stories still more stir up sensuality;
add to it vicious and stupefying
influence of low-grade dancing halls, and as
a last and finishing touch, the powerful
effect of “gang-spirit”—the hue and cry of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>the crowd of “boys,” and you will easily see
how our hero is swept away like a frail
vessel by a mighty tide into the abyss of
prostitution. This picture of every-day life
plainly shows that under ordinary circumstances
boys and men do not get into mischief
unless their minds are idle and their
judgment is clouded, unless their nerves
are high-strung and their senses are inflamed
by intoxicating and stimulating influences.
This fact carries in itself a very
valuable and encouraging lesson to those
clean-minded and refined boys who make
sincere and earnest efforts to overcome all
possible temptations and to carry securely
the treasure of their untainted manhood
thru the trying and stormy period for a
happy family life in the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a nutshell, this lesson reads: Keep
your mind busy and your body working;
do not overeat; avoid alcoholic and stimulating
liquors; be a moderate smoker; avoid
vulgar and vicious company; keep away
from degrading and low temptations that
you know will drag you down into the
abyss of vice and shame, and you will find
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>that it is not so hard to keep in the straight
path, <i>if only you do not take any chances
from the very start.</i> There is <i>no better antidote
for a young man against the annoyance
of sexual excitement than athletic
work and an athletic mode of life.</i> Any and
all physical sports and games, particularly
outdoor in the fresh air, moderate eating
and sleeping in a hard bed in a cool room,
active and busy life and avoidance of narcotic,
stimulating or body-weakening habits
and drinks will make you physically strong
and will render the problem of sexual continence
an easy and natural task for a
<i>long period of time</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such is in brief words the structure and
function of the sexual system of a man, and
such are the practical conclusions and advices
based on these theoretical facts. It
is the writer’s hope that his words of enlightenment
and counsel may keep some of
the boys away from the “danger zone.”
Yet it is natural to expect that in spite of
the best warnings and the best intentions
of the boys themselves, there will always
be such, who, thru lack of will power, light-mindedness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>or vicious influences of the
older companions, will succumb to the impulse
of the moment and will trespass the
forbidden territory of “sowing wild oats.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mainly for these victims of their own
indiscretions the writer devotes the second
part of this book—“The Pathology of the
Sexual System.” Let them know the dangers
they are courting, let them know the
possible influence it may have on their own
health and the health and happiness of their
future family. Should they be unfortunate
enough to contract a venereal disease, it is
to their own interest to know all the possible
complications and developments of
these diseases; to prevent, thru intelligent
handling of their cases, all the evil consequences
and to protect themselves from a
damage that so often follows ignorance,
neglect, and indifference to the sickness.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>Pathology (Diseases) of the Sexual System</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Before entering into detailed consideration
of the pathology, i. e., diseases of the
sexual organs, it should be stated that
while the bulk of these diseases is of venereal
character—that is, acquired thru some
abuse of the sexual function or thru unclean
intercourse—there is a large number
of diseases that may develop on and affect
the sexual organs without any fault or indiscretion
on the part of the patient.
First, the sexual organs, like any other part
of the body, can be the seat of different inflammations,
tumors, accidental injuries,
etc., and in the case of any grave general
sickness the sexual system is naturally involved
and suffers to a greater or smaller
degree. Second, the sexual organs present
very often congenital (inborn) defects of development,
varying to an enormous degree
in individual cases. There are also several
non-venereal acquired diseases. Most of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>these conditions are practically unknown to
the public, and quite often the afflicted
victims are terror-stricken and driven to
despair thru ignorance of the true nature of
their case, laboring under the idea that
their condition is due to a venereal infection
or some indiscretion on their part.
For this reason, we shall briefly consider
these conditions.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Congenital (Inborn) Non-Venereal Diseases of Sexual Organs.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Among congenital non-venereal abnormal
conditions possibly the most common
is the <i>long and tight prepuce</i>, which in a
good many cases gives rise to many nervous
complaints and minor disorders. It is relieved
usually by operation or <i>circumcision</i>,
which has been adopted by the Jews and
Mohammedans as a religious procedure.
As to the sanitary advantages of circumcision,
discussed so often, it must be admitted
that while it is not necessary in all
cases, in general it is undoubtedly a useful
procedure. It does not lessen any chances
of venereal infection, which can be seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>from the fact that the Jews proportionately
contract Gonorrhea as often as the Gentiles;
but it does undoubtedly lessen the chances
of infection with Chancre, soft or hard, and
in cases where Chancre is contracted, the
treatment in a circumcised case is a good
deal easier than in the non-circumcised.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another congenital abnormality of practical
interest is an “<i>undescended testicle</i>.”
It is not known commonly that the testicles
are not formed in the scrotum, that they
descend there before the birth of the child
from the abdominal cavity. But in some
cases the testicle does not descend until
later years of childhood, or does not descend
at all. In these cases the retention
of the testicle takes place either in the abdominal
cavity or in the groin (inguinal
canal). In this location particularly it is
likely to cause pain and distress, and it can
even atrophy and dry up from pressure of
the tissues, if not relieved by operation.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Non-Venereal Acquired Diseases.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>There are a number of non-venereal acquired
diseases that may occur on sexual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>organs. Among these should be mentioned,
first, <i>Varicocele</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Varicocele is a very common condition
in young men, and is manifested by dilation
and enlargement of the veins that go
thru the earlier described spermatic cord
to the testicle. It occurs mostly on the
left side, and is felt like a snake-like cord
twisted on itself, producing an unpleasant,
dragging-down, heavy sensation, and occasionally
real <i>neuralgic pains in the testicles</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Varicocele is usually a harmless condition,
passes away by itself as a man
grows older, and, if annoying, can be
relieved by a snugly-fitting suspensory
bandage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another very common condition which
occurs in the sexual organs is <i>Herpes</i>.
Herpes occurs as grouped in a circle, small
superficial vesicles or blisters on any part of
the sexual organs. It is perfectly harmless
and dries by itself in a few days, but it has
a peculiar tendency to recur again and
again, particularly after an intercourse,
even a clean one. The cause of its appearance
is to be sought in a certain nervous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>debility, local or general, but different local
conditions, like a long and tight prepuce,
predispose a man toward its outbreak.</p>

<p class='c007'>Herpes very often affects men who have
had some venereal disease in the past, particularly
Gonorrhea, and naturally those
men become very uneasy and worried by
breaking out of Herpes, fearing this may be
a relapse or some after development of the
old disease. It is true, tho, that a man
afflicted with herpes is very much predisposed
to Chancroidal infection, and as
herpes often resembles the beginning of
Chancroid, the opinion of a competent physician
should be secured to make proper
diagnosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is also of practical interest to know
that a number of various skin diseases can
start from and be limited to the sexual
organs, appearing as red spots, patches,
warts, etc. These cases, by being mistaken
for venereal infection, often give rise to
unnecessary worry and wrong treatment.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>
  <h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Masturbation</span> (<span class='sc'>Self-Abuse</span>).</h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Before entering into a consideration of
the venereal diseases proper, we shall consider
a sexual disorder which is extremely
important on account of its widespread
character, but the origin of which is just
the opposite to venereal diseases, as it
is due not to sexual intemperance, but to
sexual continence. This disorder is masturbation
or self-abuse, and it is rather a
sexual vice or bad habit than a disease.
Self-abuse is so widespread that some
medical writers claim that every man has
been masturbating at some time or other
in his life. The chief danger of the masturbation
habit lies in the fact that its victims
are not only adults, but children as well;
in fact, children constitute the main bulk
of its victims. The habit of masturbation
takes its roots ordinarily very early in childhood,
even babyhood. It is a well-known
fact that babies and small children, in their
search for amusement and through innocent
curiosity as to different parts of their own
body, like to handle their sexual organs.
They easily detect a very vague and pleasant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>sensation resulting from it. This gives
them the impulse and stimulation to repeat
this action, and thus is formed the first
link of the chain of the habit that may
prove later to be a curse of the child’s life.
This is the reason why mothers should
watch any tendency to bad habits in children
from a very early age, at the time when
the formation of the habit can be checked
more easily. Should the child escape the
danger of masturbation habit early in life,
the second equally dangerous period of
temptation is the school time. It is a peculiar
and most dangerous feature of the
masturbation habit that its victim feels a
strong impulse and gloats in a beastly satisfaction
if he succeeds in initiating a
younger and innocent boy into his habit.
This is why one or two vicious boys in a
class can demoralize and mislead in their
vice the whole class of younger boys. The
school age up to adolescence and puberty
is the time when the masturbation vice
rages in its greatest fury, and then it gradually
begins to abate. Getting older, the
boys learn in some way, mostly from quack
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>literature, how destructive and dangerous
is this habit, and most of them gradually
drop it, never to resume. But some of
them become so enslaved to the habit that
they cannot resist its lure, and this is the
class to which mostly belong the adult
masturbators. Masturbation has been extensively
exploited by the quack medical
literature, which claims that the habit inevitably
leads to most terrible and destructive
diseases, such as paralysis, insanity,
tuberculosis, loss of sexual power,
etc. These statements are far too sweeping
and exaggerated. Discussing the dangers
and evil consequences of the masturbation
habit, we have to consider separately the
effects of it on children on one hand, and
on adolescents or adults on the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The physical dangers and evils naturally
cannot be as serious with the adults as with
the children. First, because the adults
know its evil effects and use self-control to
limit their self-indulgence to the minimum;
second, the physical loss of seminal fluid
with each ejaculation can be easier and with
less danger spared by a grown-up body, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>the vitalizing fluid of the sexual glands is
not needed so urgently any more for the
growth and development of the body, so
the damage to an adult from the habit of
masturbation is mostly limited to his nervous
system and to his mental and moral
forces.</p>

<p class='c007'>This fact easily explains why the masturbation
habit is so destructive and dangerous
to younger children. They are unconscious
of the evil character of their
habit, and helplessly yield to the lure of
impulse; neither can they exert any self-control.
On the other hand, every drop of
sexual fluid they lose means that much of
vitality and life energy taken away from
their growing body; it means that much
loss of the natural source of their physical
health and development. It is natural,
therefore, that excessive and persistent
masturbation in younger children may lead
to physical exhaustion, may blunt their
bodily growth and dwarf their mentality,
may lead to development of epilepsy,
idiocy, and other mental diseases; in a
word, it may blight the child’s life forever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>and render him a physical and mental invalid.
The older the victim of masturbation
the smaller is the physical damage
resulting from this habit, and the more this
damage is transferred to his nervous system,
mentality, and moral character.</p>

<p class='c007'>The changes that take place in the personality
of a habitual masturbator are a
natural result of slowly-accumulating influences,
exerted by the habit on its victim.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two cardinal features in the
psychology of every masturbator which give
us a keynote toward understanding his
character, and serve as a starting point for
all subsequent changes in his personality.
The first is that every masturbator of age
knows that he is doing something wrong;
that he is committing a shameful act
against his manhood and against Nature.
As a result, he reproaches and pledges himself
to shake off this degrading habit.
But his will power is weak and temptation
is strong, and he again and again fails in
his efforts and falls back in the clutches of
his master. This internal conflict gradually
unnerves him and puts an indelible stamp
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>of shiftlessness and weakness on his whole
being. A feeling of guilt and shame makes
him morose, seclusive, depressed, and unsociable.
Particularly characteristic it is
for an inveterate masturbator to avoid the
company of all girls, and those pleasures
and games that are so attractive to normal
and healthy boys. A masturbator gets
bodily weak, flabby, and unfit for any muscular
exertion or physical work. The
changes in his nervous system and mentality
are still more striking. He becomes shiftless
and restless, and at the same time shows
signs of nervous weakness and irritability.
He sleeps bad and feels in the morning
more tired and broken up than before going
to bed; he is subject to headaches; he gets
easily tired, and is unable to concentrate
his attention for any sustained mental effort.
His personality also changes markedly; he
becomes deceitful, self-retired, cowardly,
and grouchy. His physical appearance reflects
well the internal conflict and the slow
sapping of his physical and mental strength;
his look is haggard and dejected; the eyes
are dull and deeply encircled with blue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>rings underneath; his hands are cold and
clammy; his gait is slow, feeble, and uncertain.
In a word, strong, happy, and full
of life a boy can in a few years or even
months be transformed under a loathsome
mastery of the masturbation habit into a
wreck and a mere shadow of his former
self. There is no more sad and pathetic
picture than that of an inveterate masturbator,
who wants and cannot break his
slavery to the habit. Such cases can be redeemed
back to health by a long and tedious
treatment. Much easier, and, in fact,
the only proper way to fight the scourge
of masturbation is by spreading knowledge
of its dangers among the boys.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prevention of the formation of the
habit can best be affected thru the same
physical training of the boys that has been
above recommended to check unnecessary
and premature sexual excitement. Give to
a boy whom you suspect or know to be in
danger of forming the habit of masturbation
a friendly help; take him out into the
fresh air for games and physical sports; distract
his attention by physical and mental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>pleasures; regulate his diet and mode of
life; even bring him into companionship
with clean and refined girls, and you may
save him from a slow waste and destruction
of his physical and mental health and save
his manhood for a healthy and happy
family life.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>Venereal Diseases</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Venereal diseases present a unique and
most difficult problem of our days. To realize
fully the enormous scope and difficulties
of the control of venereal peril, several
social factors bearing on this problem
must be considered. Such are: The attitude
of society to the sexual problem;
double standard of morality; prevailing ignorance
on the subject on the part of the
public; self-medication and medical quacks;
the sources of venereal infection, and the
best methods of its control.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Conspiracy of Silence.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Medically, venereal diseases belong to
the oldest and best worked out class of diseases,
tho their treatment only recently, due
to the new discoveries, has been put on a
definite and secure basis. Socially, their
tremendous importance for the health,
morals, and happiness of a community is
just being disclosed to society, which heretofore,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>in its prudish and ostrich-like attitude,
attempted to solve the problem of
venereal peril by ignoring it and suppressing
free discussion or preventive education along
these lines. Naturally, the evil unchecked,
tho driven underground by a prohibition of
publicity, has spread to such a monstrous
size that society could not any more feign
not to see it and to continue the old policy
of “conspiracy of silence.”</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Double Standard of Morals.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Among factors bearing on the causes of
sexual intemperance and venereal peril,
possibly none stands out as clearly and
prominently as the so-called double standard
of morals. We all know that society
has adopted and hypocritically approved a
double code of sexual morality for men and
women. What is considered to be natural
and permissible for a man is an offense of
morality and a crime punishable by social
disgrace for a woman. No man is willing
to marry a girl whom he knows or suspects
to be of loose sexual morals, and no self-respecting
man will tolerate that the fair
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>name and honor of his sister be attacked or
ruined even by a word, not to say in fact.
And yet the same man, in full sincerity and
in accord with his conscience gives to himself
a free license of “sowing wild oats” before
his marriage. In fact, many men believe
that it is not only permissible, but
even desirable for a young man to work off
a surplus of his physical manhood before
he settles down to family life. How a
squandering of the best physical and nervous
energy in dissipation, how a waste and
perversion of the highest spiritual and
moral instinct of love by a degrading purchase
of the body of a prostitute, how a
polluting of the young and pure blood with
venereal poisons can make a man a better
husband and father is beyond human reason
and common sense to comprehend; but the
superstitions and barbaric notions of the
good old days are dying hard, and thousands
of young men sacrifice their manhood to
the deep-rooted traditions and to the slavery
of established social habits.</p>

<p class='c007'>How this double code of sexual morality
has developed is probably to be explained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>by a combination of several factors. First,
a historically developed subjection of the
woman to man naturally has led to the
domination of man’s ideas and laws, and to
the interpretation of different facts bearing
on the relationship between man and woman
in favor of the man. To justify his own
license of sexual intemperance and deny the
same freedom to a woman, it was easy for a
man to declare that the sexual necessity for
a woman is not as imperative as for a man,
and therefore a woman shall be chaste and
pure until the marriage, while the man may
suit himself in this regard. There is no
scientific proof whatsoever that a woman
differs in any way from a man in regard to
the sexual instinct. It is true that woman,
as an average, is purer, more temperate, less
attracted by mere animal, brutal passion,
and often seeks or tolerates a physical gratification
only as the means to get with it a
man’s love and affection. On the other
hand, a man is more brutal and violent in
seeking and satisfying his physical passion,
less able to control his sexual impulse, less
affectionate and less sentimental in his expression
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>of love. But this comparative
moderation, modesty, and better self-control
can be more easily explained by
woman’s training thru many generations in
clean and moral habits of thought and living,
by the fewer chances of exposure to
evil influences, by less stimulation and intoxication
thru liquors and tobacco, and
last, but not least, thru fear of public disgrace.
The man, being master of the situation,
has never tried to develop self-control
and will power in subduing his
physical passion, and has cloaked his sexual
intemperance and indulgence with a fancied
natural necessity. The double moral standard
as it is practiced to-day has brought
untold misery and has ruined lives of
millions of young women who were so unfortunate
as to make a first misstep and
yielded to temptation. While the male seducer
goes on unmolested and unnoticed on
his gay round of life, the girl, his helpless
victim, has to face all the fury of public
disgrace and contempt. Many of them
commit suicide, others try to hide their
disgrace by a criminal operation and die or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>cripple their health for life. Many more, in
despair and revolt against the injustice and
hypocrisy of public opinion, enter the gates
that swing only one way to slow decay and
untimely death, the gates of prostitution.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no more miserable existence,
no more hopeless, no more body and soul-wrecking
life than that of a white slave. It
is no accident that practically all of the
prostitutes are drinking and smoking, and
that the majority of them are also drug
fiends. In fact, that should rather be
credited in their favor, as it shows that
with clear judgment and normal senses
they cannot endure this degradation and
life-long slavery, and, since they do not see
any possibility of breaking their chains and
redeeming their lives, they drug themselves
to forget their misery. Yet even continual
drugging cannot dull the agony of their
hopeless existence, and many of them welcome
death at their own hands, usually thru
poison. There is no other occupation or
human walk of life where the suicide rate is as
high as among the slaves of prostitution,
neither is there any class of population where
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>physical decay and premature death is as
common as among the women of the underworld.
Let a man or youth who enters a
house of prostitution know that by doing
so he is not only purchasing a lottery ticket
for the prize of a venereal disease, which he
seldom misses, but that also with each visit
to a fallen woman he drags her down one
step lower on the down-grade path of a
social abyss. And if he can do this with
full knowledge of the social consequences of
his act with a clear mind and cool judgment,
let him know that he is a man in
name only, and that morally he is much
more to be despised and branded with social
contempt than the painted creature he
is ashamed to recognize on the street the
morning after.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>The Dangers of Ignorance.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>There are three main venereal diseases
which constitute the roots of the giant tree
of the venereal peril, and from which almost
all venereal disorders spring out like
branches and twigs. They are Gonorrhea,
Syphilis, and Chancroid. The first two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>easily overshadow in widespread distribution
and dangers of complications the third
member of the venereal triad, so that
Chancroid can be considered by far the
least dangerous of the three.</p>

<p class='c007'>A conservative estimate of the spread of
venereal diseases, in the writer’s opinion,
would be that from every hundred men, at
least ninety have had at one time or another
a venereal infection; that from every
hundred cases of venereal diseases, not half
of them receive a thorough and scientific
treatment, not half of the patients are aware
of the seriousness of their condition and
possibilities of different complications, and
only a minority of them bring the treatment
to a complete and permanent recovery.
Any physician doing genito-urinary
work both in a clinic, hospital, or private
practice knows that most of the patients
take treatment only until they cure up
their pains, sores, and other symptoms of
the disease, and not until they are completely
cured. As it were, they dismiss the
physician; the physician does not dismiss
them. As a result of this unsystematic and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>superficial treatment, the original disease
recurs again and again, only each time it
penetrates a little deeper into the system
and requires a longer period of time for a
complete cure, with less chances for success.
Thousands and thousands of men
develop serious and deep-reaching complications,
sapping their vitality and undermining
their strength, complications which
would never have happened if the disease
had been treated from the start, thoroughly
and to the finish. Still another result of
this indifferent and reckless attitude is that
thousands of men, believing themselves
cured, take upon themselves the grave responsibility
of entering marriage, taking a
pure and fresh girl, the girl they love and
revere with all their hearts, trusting and
unsuspecting of the terrible danger hovering
over her head. The disease-producing
germs that have been weakened and stunned
but not killed by insufficient treatment,
falling on a virgin and fertile soil, take on a
new lease of life, and with the fury of a
devastating tornado attack and ruin their
new victim. A young bride often before
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>the honeymoon bliss is over is struck down
with an acute infection, a mutilating operation
follows, and in a few months a beautiful,
healthy girl is transformed into a permanent
invalid and nervous wreck, deprived
forever of beauty, health, and joy of life.
This terrible tragedy is not an exceptional
case, it is not an overdrawn statement, it is
an every-day occurrence in medical practice,
and every day adds its new victims of
men’s folly, criminal indifference, and recklessness
born of ignorance.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Self-Medication and Medical Quacks.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>That the average boy or man has not
the slightest idea about all the possible
complications that may develop from a
venereal infection is best shown by their
attitude in time of such venereal mishap.
What is an average boy doing when he discovers
that he is a victim of a venereal
mishap? The very first thing he does is to
confide his shocking surprise to one of his
companions, who he knows has already
had a similar experience. The experienced
friend first gives him a hearty laugh over
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>his bad luck, and then assuming a wise
look, pats him on the shoulder and confidently
tells him not to worry, as he “will
fix him all right.” He gives him a few
general instructions, the kind he used to
follow in his own previous experience, and
sends him to the drug store for a certain
kind of pills, capsules, or solutions for injections.
If there be no such friend at hand,
some other amateur “expert” is consulted;
sometimes it is a barber, or even a bartender
friend who gives an advice to drive out
the sickness by copious drinking of beer.
A grade higher in quality, but equally poor
and uncertain in results is a consultation
with the neighboring druggist, who, not
having any more knowledge about the developments
of diseases than the average
layman, takes up the case with the supreme
confidence of an authority and hands over
the counter the best advertised pills or solution
for injections. The best that can happen
to the beneficiary of these consultations
is, that he will not see at once any improvement,
or that he will feel worse, then he will
go to a competent physician and will start
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>regular treatment. But woe to him if he
will feel some symptomatic relief, some
checking of the discharge or the pains.
This is the time when he is the real loser.
Fooled by the temporary improvement and
by clearing up of the symptoms of his disease
into belief that he is cured or pretty nearly
cured, and encouraged in his belief by his
equally ignorant and often unscrupulous
adviser, the patient resumes his former
mode of life and discontinues what little
precaution or treatment he has been using.
The natural result of it is that a few weeks
later, after some indiscretion like drinking
alcoholic liquors or dancing, the whole sickness
comes back as strong and violent as in
its very beginning. Again he resumes his
treatment and care, and acute symptoms
again quiet down until, under a new provocation,
the disease will break out once
more. Thus trusting and ignorant victims
of venereal mishap, wasting time and often
considerable money on their amateur doctoring,
let the roots of the sickness untouched,
allow it to penetrate deeper and
deeper into the body and develop some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>deep complication or permanent damage of
the sexual system, which is either incurable
or at best requires many months of the
most painstaking treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Probably the most pitiful of all venereal
patients are those unfortunates who either
have no friends in whom they could confide,
or who, thru a false feeling of shame,
do not care to have a personal consultation,
and resort to a treatment by mail thru one
of the quack medical concerns. In no other
class of diseases, in fact in no other walk of
life, is human ignorance, suffering, and fear
so cruelly and unscrupulously abused and
penalized as in venereal diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shielded from criminal persecution by
the secret manner of dealing with their
trusting patrons, secure in their shady operations
by the fear of disgrace, and a reluctance
on the part of their victims to
bring to publicity the fact of their venereal
infection, these human vultures ply their
extortionate trade on thousands and thousands
of men. Most extravagant claims,
guarantees of cure, regardless of what the
sickness is, most blatant, alluring advertisements
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>and offers of free examinations—these
are the stock of trade used by these
leeches waxing fat on human ignorance and
degradation. Fortunately, in recent years
the attention of State and Federal government
has been called to the use of the mail
by these benefactors of suffering humanity
for extortionate purposes. Energetic steps
have been taken to curtail and abolish this
criminal correspondence game and to close
up many of these establishments. Public
opinion is aroused on the subject, and it
demands that the newspapers refuse and
eliminate all fraudulent and alluring ads.
of quack medical institutions. In the meantime
the campaign of information and enlightenment
should be carried on, and every
young man should be informed that reckless
and indifferent treatment of venereal diseases,
self-doctoring, cures by correspondence,
and “sure cures” by medical quack
institutes may prove as disastrous as the
disease itself.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Prostitution.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Considering the sources of venereal infection
and the best possible methods of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>control of venereal peril, one strikes at once
the sinister problem of prostitution. Prostitution
is undoubtedly the main source of
venereal infection, but the term prostitution
should be taken broadly. There are two
kinds of prostitution: one is openly organized
in red-light district, tolerated by
society, and regulated by the police; and
another, secret, clandestine, practised by
thousands of women and girls in large towns,
women who do not make a living from the
“life of shame,” but secretly indulge in
illicit sexual intercourse for a side income
or presents, while trying to keep up an appearance
and social standing of a “respectable”
woman. Which kind of prostitution
is more dangerous to morals and health is
not settled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many medical and social authorities believe
that a woman secretly prostituting
herself is more dangerous and more liable
to spread venereal infection than an open
registered prostitute, just because she is
secret, and does not have to submit to
medical inspection at any time. Yet it
must be admitted that the medical inspection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>of houses of prostitution has failed to bring
about the expected results and to give protection
from venereal infection. It is well
established that every prostitute is infected
with gonorrhea or syphilis, and
mostly with both, and that they practically
at all times carry this disease in active or
latent form. The degree to which they can
transmit a venereal infection to a man depends
mostly on the stage of the disease
in the prostitute at the time of her visit by
a man; that is, one time danger is greater
than at another, but <i>at no time the perfunctory
medical examination given to prostitutes
as it is conducted under police regulations
can give the slightest guarantee of
safety from venereal infection</i>. All it can
establish and claim is that no acute or
active symptoms or lesions have been found
on examination, and that there is no urgent
necessity to move this woman to the hospital
as an evident and prolific source of
venereal infection. In other words, medical
inspection can single out and isolate a
few of the most flagrant and most evident
cases of venereal diseases, but the women
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>not excluded by medical examination from
plying their trade are just as able to carry
over venereal infection to a man as their
sisters removed to the hospital. In fact,
the reduction in the number of venereal infections
because of isolation of a few most
flagrant cases is so slight, and the increase
in the number of venereal infections due to
increase in numbers of exposures by men,
who are misled into a feeling of security by
alleged medical inspection, is so great that
many medical authorities and sanitarians
consider medical inspection of houses of
prostitution useless and even harmful.</p>

<p class='c007'>As mentioned above, a “secret” prostitute
and private lady friend is not a bit
more safe and secure from transmitting
venereal infection, and in many cases, contrary
to the expectations and beliefs of
men, are much more dangerous and treacherous
in this respect. It is almost humorous,
if it were not so pathetic, to see how dumbfounded
and shocked are these youthful
transgressors of the forbidden path, when a
physician declares that the exceptional favors
of their lady friend resulted in a bad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>case of gonorrhea or chancre. They are
sincerely indignant at the reflection on the
honor of their affinity, and are almost ready
to doubt the competency of the physician,
until a microscopical examination and the
subsequent course of the disease convinces
them of the sad truth. On occasions of this
character a man as a rule is always inclined
to blame the woman and accuse her of gross
deception. Such attitude is entirely wrong,
and is based on the ignorance of clinical
facts. The truth of the matter is that while
a man can always tell when something is
the matter with him, and can always notice
or perceive some evidence of the venereal
disease, such as a discharge, pains, sores,
etc., a woman hardly ever is aware of her
disease. In fact, women feel pains, discomfort,
and suffer acute distress only in
the acute stage of venereal diseases, at the
very beginning of the infection. But after
this acute period is over, they may sincerely
believe themselves well, as no pain or any
symptom unusual for them calls their attention
to it. Therefore the noble indignation
of these trespassers on forbidden ground
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>is unjust and unwarranted, and the only
party to blame is their own ignorance and
lack of self-control.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only sure way to avoid a venereal
exposure is to avoid the exposure and to
keep away from the danger zone.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Practical Prophylaxis (Prevention).</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Different methods have been suggested
to minimize the chances of venereal infection.
One of them is the use of rubber protectors,
“condom,” but the protection they
give is far from certain, as they occasionally
tear, and also the infection may be implanted
in parts beyond the protected area.</p>

<p class='c007'>The United States Army and Navy, as
well as some European governments, have
introduced some preventive ointments for
syphilis and injections for gonorrhea, but
these preventive measures to be effective
must be applied at once after the exposure,
and in a most thorough and careful manner.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>
  <h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Venereal Diseases.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>As mentioned before, there are three
venereal diseases, which constitute the main
bulk of venereal cases, and which are at
the bottom and the cause of most venereal
disorders. They are Gonorrhea, Syphilis,
and Chancroid. These diseases are produced
each by a different and separate kind
of germ; they develop independently one
from another, and they can never change
one into another. But they can coexist in
one patient; i. e., a man can get at the same
time gonorrhea and Chancroid. If this
double infection takes place, then both diseases
have to be treated at the same time.
The fact that a man has already one disease
in a chronic form does not prevent him
from getting another. Equally so, the fact
that a man has already once had a venereal
disease does not prevent him from contracting
it a second time, nor does it make
it less likely to occur. This is particularly
true in the case of gonorrhea and Chancroid,
but much less in syphilis, in which an infection
for a second time is rather rare.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>
  <h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Prognosis (Prediction as to the Future Development) of Venereal Diseases.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The popular mind usually estimates the
danger, seriousness, and probable duration
of any disease by the amount and intensity
of pains, by the violence and rapidity of
its development, and by the degree of disability
that the sickness inflicts on a man.
Nothing could be farther from the truth
than this belief in the case of general internal
diseases, and still more in regard to
venereal diseases. The most destructive,
most malignant incurable diseases in most
of the cases begin slowly, insidiously, without
acute and severe pain, hardly attracting
the attention of the patient, and for a
long time not interfering at all, or very
little, with his working capacity. Often
the patient wakes up and takes notice of
the disease only after it has gotten deeply
into his system and holds him in its clutches,
never to release him. On the other hand,
many acute diseases, that start with a high
fever, violent pains, and other alarming
and terrifying symptoms to the patient,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>under intelligent care pass away just as
quickly as they come, and leave the patient
without any permanent damage. This is
particularly true in regard to venereal diseases.
<i>Do not judge the seriousness and
dangerous nature of a venereal disease by
the amount of pain and discomfort it brings
to you.</i> In no other respect are the venereal
patients as much misled and fooled as in
this, and no other mistake brings as much
unnecessary and preventable suffering and
financial loss. Only a competent physician,
after a careful observation and repeated examination
with the special methods, can
give a correct estimation as to the danger
and probable duration of the disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>Remember also that the best and most
learned specialist cannot promise you a
perfect cure in a specified time, but he can
give you only a probable duration of the
disease, liable to be changed by many unforeseen
circumstances; and keep away from
a man who “guarantees a sure cure” in so
many weeks or months. The treatment of
venereal diseases can never be forced and
hurried thru in a certain period of time,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and those patients who insist on a doctor’s
pushing the treatment in forced marches
always <a id='t80'></a>strike a bad bargain and are
doomed to disappointment by a relapse of
the disease or the development of serious
complications.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Gonorrhea.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Gonorrhea, commonly termed a clap, is
unquestionably the most widespread of
venereal diseases. So common it is, so insidious
and deceiving in its appearance,
that most men fail to realize its serious and
often dangerous nature and regard it as a
trifling affection. How often one hears boys
repeat this hackneyed and silly expression,
“I would rather have a clap than a bad
cold.” What childish recklessness, what
arrogant ignorance, and how terribly it is
punished and regretted later on!</p>

<p class='c007'>The more medical and social workers
study the clinical and social ravages produced
by gonorrhea and its complications,
the more they are impressed by its enormous
and far-reaching destructive power on human
health and happiness. It is a wellestablished
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>opinion among the medical scientists
at the present time that the total
amount of damage and suffering to individuals
and to society at large produced by
gonorrhea falls not far below that produced
by Syphilis, which is justly known as a
black scourge of humanity. Gonorrhea is
considered now a very serious disease, requiring,
for a complete and permanent recovery,
long and painstaking treatment.
The complications of gonorrhea are numerous
and far-reaching. <i>Ninety per cent of
inborn blindness in children</i> in institutions
for the blind are <i>due to Gonorrhea</i>, and tens
of thousands of little sightless victims are a
pitiful evidence of the disastrous consequences
following the neglect or indifferent
handling of Gonorrhea cases. It is also
known that possibly half of all operations
performed on women are due to neglected
or unrecognized cases of Gonorrhea, and
thousands and thousands of young women
become permanent invalids thru the ignorance
or indifference of their husbands.
Only a Genito-Urinary specialist, who sees
how many of these cases are mistreated or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>untreated because they are regarded by the
patients as trifling and not worthy of any
particular attention, who sees how these
cases, once the sickness takes deep roots in
the body, drag on for months and months
in spite of the best treatment; only a physician
can realize to the full extent how
seriously and carefully each case of Gonorrheal
infection must be handled. The
respect and fear of Gonorrhea comes to
young men only after a sad and distressing
experience as an afterthought. How much
better it would be as a forethought. It is
the writer’s hope that the following lines
will serve as a torch of knowledge, shedding
light and guiding to safety the traveler
through the darkness and dangers of sex
ignorance.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Diagnosis (Recognition of Gonorrhea).</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Gonorrhea is an inflammation of the lining
of the urethral canal, produced by a certain
kind of germ called <i>Gonococci</i>. These
germs are so small that millions of them
can be found in one drop of pus (matter),
and they can be seen under a microscope
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>grouped in pairs, and resembling in shape
the halves of coffee beans put together.
Gonorrhea is also called a <i>specific urethritis</i>,
which means an inflammation of the urethra
caused by a specific germ, to be distinguished
from a <i>simple non-specific urethritis</i>,
produced by other germs not Gonococci.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a great difference in seriousness
and possibilities of developing various dangerous
complications between real Gonorrhea,
i. e., specific and simple non-specific
urethritis. Simple urethritis is a
mild and harmless catarrh of the urethra,
which ordinarily clears up in from one to
two weeks with a very simple treatment and
even without treatment. Simple urethritis
never leads to any deep or dangerous complications,
never goes into the blood of the
patient, and does not carry over affection
to the wife and children. Unfortunately,
from every hundred cases of urethritis, the
majority of them, not less than ninety per
cent, are real Gonorrhea, and the balance
of ten cases are simple urethritis. For a
man who has contracted a venereal affection
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>of this character it is of greatest importance
to determine whether his case is
a simple urethritis or real Gonorrhea; but
this is not as simple as could be desired,
and as most of the patients believe it is.
It is absolutely impossible to differentiate
between real Gonorrhea and simple urethritis
by the clinical appearance of the case
or to estimate the seriousness and duration
of the case by the visible symptoms, such
as the amount of discharge, intensity of
pains, etc. Not only the patient, but <i>even
the physician can not establish the presence
of Gonorrhea in the case without a microscopical
examination</i>. A man who claims
to be able to estimate the nature and seriousness
of the case from the looks of things
is either an ignoramus or impostor, or both.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Clinical Course of an Acute Gonorrhea.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The first signs of Gonorrhea usually appear
not before two and not later than five
days after unclean intercourse. This is the
so-called <i>incubation period</i>—a period that
differs in length in various diseases. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>first thing that attracts the patient’s attention
is a slight itching or tickling feeling
and a sense of heat in the end of the penis.
From twelve to twenty-four hours later a
swelling is noticed at the opening of the
urethral canal, and a whitish discharge begins
to ooze from the canal. This discharge
begins to increase rapidly in thickness and
amount, and soon a greenish yellow thick
pus begins to flow profusely. Correspondingly,
the swelling and inflammation increase
more and more, and urination becomes
more difficult and painful, very often
so agonizing that the patient holds the
urine as long as he possibly can. <i>Usually
it takes from one to two weeks until the
sickness reaches its climax, then for a week
or two it stands at the same height, and
from the third or fourth week it begins
to go down</i>, the discharge diminishes in
amount, turns to creamy white, then becomes
thinner, slimy, the urine becomes
clearer and clearer, and <i>in five to six weeks
from the beginning of the disease the patient
recovers completely</i>. This is the
course of a somewhat normal case of Gonorrhea,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>with smooth, regular development
and without any complications. <i>A man
must consider himself very lucky if he recovers
from Gonorrhea in five to six weeks
completely.</i> Only a small minority of all
Gonorrhea cases run so smoothly, probably
not more than 25 to 30 per cent. The majority
of the cases, sometimes in spite of
the best treatment and the best care, develop
different complications, which increase
the duration of the disease for a much
longer period.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Complications of Gonorrhea.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>In the beginning of Gonorrhea the inflammation
is limited to the front part of
the urethral canal, but in many cases the
inflammation goes in deeper and spreads to
the rear part of the urethral canal nearer to
the bladder.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Deep Gonorrhea.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Acute deep Gonorrhea is usually brought
about by some indiscretion on the part of
the patient, such as violent physical exercise
like running, jumping, dancing, or it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>may be also produced by drinking of alcoholic
liquors or by strong and improperly
done injections at the hands of self-doctoring
patients. It develops usually from the
third or fifth week from the beginning of
the sickness. The first symptom of acute
deep Gonorrhea is the increase in frequency
and painful urination. The most
characteristic feature is that the <i>pains are
not felt in the beginning or during the act of
urination, but right at the end of it</i>, due to
spasmodic contractions of the deep urethral
muscle on highly inflamed parts. Another
distressing feature is the frequency and
urgency of urination, so that the patient
cannot hold back his urine for a moment,
but has to void it immediately. One more
symptom that often misleads the patient
into the belief that he is getting better, while
in reality the opposite is true, is a rather
<i>sudden stoppage of the discharge</i>, which
has been rather free. At the same time
quite often a drop or two of bloody discharge
appears at the close of urination,
accompanied with the intense spasmodic
pains mentioned above. This combination
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>of symptoms makes the acute deep Gonorrhea
a most distressing and alarming
complication to the patient, and frequently
he wakes up for the first time on this occasion
to a full realization of the serious and
dangerous nature of Gonorrhea. Acute
deep Gonorrhea, under intelligent care,
subsides and quiets down in two to three
weeks, but for a complete cure it takes
from six to eight weeks more, so that all
together these cases take from two to three
months. The importance of Acute Deep
Gonorrhea lies mainly in the fact that
it indicates that Gonorrhea Germs have
penetrated deep into the system, opening a
gateway for other deep and serious complications.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Gonorrheal Inflammation of the Testicle (Epididymitis).</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The nearest place for Gonorrheal germs
to invade from the deep Urethra is that
part of the testicle which consists of
the twisted and folded on itself spermatic
duct; this part is called the <i>Epididymis</i>,
which means the <i>appendix of the testicle</i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>Epididymitis starts usually quite abruptly,
from three to five weeks from the beginning,
after some physical exertion, like too
fast or too much walking, running, jumping,
dancing, wrestling, etc. It starts with
a high fever, headache, feeling of heat and
weight, and agonizing pain in the testicle.
Every motion and walking becomes impossible
and the patient has to take to bed.
The testicle in its rear part becomes swollen,
sometimes to twice or even more its normal
size, and hard. Under proper care, the
acute symptoms of pain and swelling <i>subside
in two to three weeks</i> and the patient
is able to resume his work, but a part of
the swelling and hardness remains and can
be felt for many, many months, until it
gradually disappears thru slow absorption;
yet in some cases a small, hard nodule remains
forever. The main danger of Epididymitis
is just in this very possibility, that
the spermatic duct may be partially or
completely obstructed and blocked permanently
by the inflammation, in consequence
of which no spermatozoa can go
out from the testicle of this side, and <i>if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Epididymitis occurs on both sides</i>, which
happens often, then obliteration of the
spermatic ducts is complete; in other words,
<i>the man can never have children—he becomes
sterile</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Gonorrheal Buboes.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Among acute complications of Gonorrhea
should be mentioned also buboes, very
much dreaded by the patients, who are
pleased to call them, for some reason,
“blue balls.” Buboes are a swelling of the
glands in the groin, which can be felt as
hard and tender knots. Gonorrheal buboes
are very harmless, usually go down promptly
under treatment, and very seldom form an
abscess.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Chronic Gonorrhea (Gleet).</span></h3>

<p class='c015'><i>A case of Gonorrhea that lasts longer
than three months is called chronic.</i> There
is a number of different conditions that
may keep Gonorrhea up for many months
and even years. Chronic Gonorrhea differs
from acute by the absence of pains, swelling,
or any other violent or acute symptom.
The discharge is either very slight, just a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>drop in the morning (so-called <i>good morning
drop</i>) or none at all. Frequently a man
feels no discomfort of any kind and does
not notice anything abnormal, except possibly
a slight pasting and glueing of the
urethral canal, in which cases only a close
examination of the urine will show that it
is full of shreds; but a large majority of the
cases of chronic Gonorrhea is accompanied
with more or less copious discharge, commonly
called Gleet.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chronic Gonorrhea may be limited either
to the front part of the Urethra or to the
deep rear part.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Prostatitis (Gonorrheal Inflammation of the Prostate Gland).</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>A most frequent cause of Chronic Gonorrhea
is the extension of the Gonorrheal
infection into the Prostate Gland, which, as
mentioned above, lies deep between the
Urethra and the bladder. Once Gonococci
have penetrated into the deep recesses of
the Prostate Gland, they secure there a very
strong foothold, and it is very hard to reach
and dislodge them with an ordinary treatment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>Gonococci may lay dormant in the
Prostate Gland, producing very few active
symptoms and very little annoyance and
discomfort to the patient, who may consider
himself well, or pretty near well, and
suddenly, after some indiscretion like dancing
or use of alcoholic liquors, the germs
take a new lease of life and precipitate an
acute outbreak of Gonorrhea. The patients
as a rule believe that they have contracted
a fresh case, while in reality it is a case of
reinfection from their own prostate gland.
These cases of rekindling of old Gonorrheal
prostatitis can repeat themselves many,
many times, until the true cause is discovered,
and the Prostate Gland is cleaned
up thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c007'>A chronic Gonorrheal Prostatitis is an
extremely common infection. Probably not
less than half of the Chronic Gonorrhea
cases are due to the involvement of the
Prostate Gland. The tissue of the Prostate
Gland is extremely rich in nerves, and its
chronic inflammation, thru the pressure and
irritation of different nerve endings, produces
pains and discomfort, not only locally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>in the genital organs, but also far away in
different parts of the body. Locally, the
<i>symptoms of chronic prostatitis are a whitish,
milky discharge from the urethral canal</i>,
particularly <i>after urination or defecation</i>
(stool), and <i>a deeply-seated feeling of weight
or deep burnings</i>. From distant pains produced
by the irritation of the nerve endings,
most common are pains in the legs,
in the back, in the region of the stomach,
and headaches. In fact, very often patients
come complaining of pains in different parts
of the body, without having the slightest
suspicion that the cause of it all is their
infected Prostate Gland. One of the most
distressing features of chronic Gonorrhea
prostatitis is its powerful, depressing influence
on the patient’s spirit and mentality.
No other complication of Gonorrhea wears
down a man’s courage, self-assertiveness,
and joy of life, none of them makes a patient
so disheartened, worried, and despairing
of recovery as does chronic Prostatitis.
Gonorrheal Prostatitis, under the best treatment,
takes usually several months for a
complete cure, and the task to keep up a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>patient’s courage and confidence in his recovery
taxes as much the physician’s skill
as the treatment itself.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Gonorrheal Strictures.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Next to Gonorrheal Prostatitis in frequency
and practical importance should be
mentioned stricture. In fact, in many cases
it is much more dangerous, as the old
neglected stricture can never be cured
completely, while prostatitis, even in the
old cases, almost always can be brought to
a satisfactory condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>The stricture is a scar, forming gradually
and slowly after an uncured Gonorrhea.
Usually these scars are a result of
row patches in the urethral canal that quite
frequently develop during a chronic Gonorrhea.
These patches, so-called <i>granulation
patches</i>, what the public calls “wild
flesh,” are a common source of pains
and persistent discharge, lasting for many
months. These granulation patches can be
discovered only thru a special instrument
called  <i>urethroscope</i>, which introduces electric
light in the urethral canal and makes possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>a clear and exact inspection of its entire
surface. If these patches are not discovered
or not properly treated, they may
heal up slowly by themselves, but not in a
natural way with the restoration of the
normal size and smooth lining of the canal.
They will heal up with a scar that has a
peculiar ability to shrink and to contract.
As a result of it, the normal (lumen) channel
of the urethral canal is interrupted, twisted,
and obstructed, partially or completely,
which leads to a retention or a stoppage of
urine. The granulation patches are soft in
the beginning, and can be cured without
difficulty in very few weeks or months; but
after they have turned into a stricture the
treatment is immeasurably harder and
longer. In fact, the <i>very old strictures cannot
be cured completely, but only relieved
temporarily</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main danger of a stricture is its
slow and insidious development. It takes
many months for a granulating patch to
turn into a fresh stricture, and it takes
years to form an old stricture. For months
and years a patient may have no discomfort
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>nor symptoms sufficient to call his attention
to his condition, and by the time
he begins to feel some annoyance and to
notice some disturbance, the stricture is already
old and incurable. Therefore it is
highly important for any man who has had
the misfortune to contract Gonorrhea to
secure a positive assurance that he is in no
danger of developing a stricture later. The
active symptoms of stricture are: (Gleet),
a <i>slimy discharge, particularly in the morning;
frequency of urination and a slow,
dribbling, weak stream of urine</i>; but, as
mentioned above, these symptoms develop
long after the stricture is formed, and no
man should wait for their development.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Gonorrheal Rheumatism.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The last, and by no means a rare complication
of Gonorrhea, is rheumatism.
Gonorrheal Rheumatism usually sets in abruptly
at any time in the course of disease,
and commonly attacks ankle, wrist, knee,
or elbow joints. Clinically, it strikingly resembles
a common acute rheumatism, but
the treatment which is efficacious for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>common variety of rheumatism is perfectly
useless in Gonorrheal. Gonorrheal Rheumatism
is a very serious complication; it
causes a good deal of suffering, it takes
many weeks or months for a complete recovery,
and in many cases leaves behind
stiff joints and permanent disability.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Treatment of Gonorrhea.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>We shall proceed now to describe briefly
the general principles and methods of the
treatment of Gonorrhea and its complications,
as we believe that the intelligent understanding
of these methods will help men
afflicted with Gonorrhea to avoid blunders
of self-doctoring and exploitation by ignorant
impostors and unscrupulous medical
quacks. The acquaintance with scientific
methods of treatment of Gonorrhea considered
the best at the present time should
prove conclusively to these men that to
protect themselves against dangerous complications
and permanent injurious aftereffects
of Gonorrhea, they should not trust
their health either to friends ever ready
with advice nor to the alluring and highsounding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>promises of quacks; it would show
that <i>there is no short cut to a cure of Gonorrhea</i>;
that this cure can be effected only
by systematic and persistent treatment at
the hands of a competent physician.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first point of importance to remember
in the treatment of Gonorrhea is
that Gonorrhea is essentially a local disease,
and that it penetrates into the blood
in the whole system very seldom; in fact,
only in one complication, Gonorrheal Rheumatism.
This fact readily explains why
the <i>main treatment of Gonorrhea is local</i>,
and why the internal treatment with drugs
is of secondary importance, and in many
cases can be omitted altogether. Yet the
public at large seems to believe as religiously
as ever in the magic power of
different potent drugs, such as “blue”
capsules, cubeba, copaive balsams, santal
oil, etc. This medical superstition unfortunately
is encouraged and kept up by manufacturers
and dispensers of these drugs
for commercial reasons, as well as by many
healers disqualified by the law or the lack
of special training and equipment.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>
  <h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Treatment of Acute Gonorrhea.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The very first request a gonorrheal patient
addresses to a physician is to stop the
discharge as soon as he can. Should the
physician comply with this request, he
would show by doing so not only a complete
ignorance of the subject, but he would also
do a great deal of harm to the patient himself
by driving the disease inside instead of
outside. The popular fear of a discharge is
based on the ignorance of the fact that the
discharge in Gonorrhea, like many other
symptoms, such as fever, cough, vomiting,
etc., in other diseases, are not harmful by
themselves, and that in a certain stage of
the disease they serve a useful purpose of
helping the human body to get rid of
the different poisons and disease-producing
germs. So in Gonorrhea the thick, greenish
yellow discharge helps along the Nature to
throw off and to eliminate Gonococci, and
until this purpose is accomplished, to check
a discharge is not only unnecessary, but
absolutely harmful. Therefore, <i>in the early
stage of Gonorrhea</i> intelligent treatment calls
for injection with antiseptic drugs that kill
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>Gonococci and rather <i>stimulate a discharge
than check it</i>. Only later, in from three to
four weeks, when the character of the discharge
shows that all Gonococci are already
eliminated, and that therefore the discharge
has outlived its usefulness, only then the
physician is justified in giving injections
with the binding or astringent drugs, that
check and gradually stop the discharge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ignorance or a deliberate violation of
this rule in a foolhardy attempt to make a
short cut to a cure has caused, in thousands
and thousands of cases, a penetration of
Gonorrhea into the deeper organs and has
led to numberless complications and injurious
aftereffects.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The injections</i> can be started usually at
once, with the exception of the few very
acute cases, where the swelling and pains
are so severe that it is necessary to wait a
few days before starting the injections. It
is in these cases particularly that the use
of the internal drugs, usually mild antiseptics,
is advisable until local treatment
can be started. In making injections, one
point should never be overlooked: this is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>to <i>urinate each time before making an injection</i>;
failure to do this has driven many
gonorrheas into the deeper parts.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Diet and a General Regime in Gonorrhea.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The dietetic and general regime in an
acute Gonorrhea is just as important as the
medical treatment. In the <i>first three to
four weeks as much rest and quiet as a
patient can possibly secure</i> is a very important
condition to prevent injurious complications.
Too much or too fast walking, running,
jumping, dancing, wrestling, etc.,
should be absolutely prohibited. A well-fitting
suspensory bandage should be put
on at once. That alcoholic liquors are
tabooed is pretty well known to the public,
except a very few tyros that still believe
that beer can drive out the disease. All
stimulating drinks, like coffee, chocolate,
strong tea, and sharp seasoned food should
be avoided until the acute stage is over.
Drinking of plenty of plain water should be
encouraged, as the resulting copious urine
provides a natural and most efficient drainage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>and elimination of the dirt of the
urethral canal. Less meat and more milk
and cereals is the best diet for an acute
stage of Gonorrhea. There is no objection
to moderate smoking. It stands to reason
that any sexual excitement or stimulation
is extremely harmful and aggravates the
condition immensely. Absolute cleanliness
must be insisted upon, and the patient must
be careful not to spread the disease by soiling
with gonorrheal discharge different articles
of personal use that may be used by
others. He must be careful also not to
carry over a gonorrheal poison with the
soiled fingers into his own eyes, as <i>gonorrhea
of the eye is a most dangerous disease</i>
that often leads to complete blindness.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Treatment of Gonorrheal Complications.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The closing stage of acute Gonorrhea is
the only time when a patient can be allowed
to take a part in the treatment by making
injections at home after careful and personal
instruction by a physician. All the rest of
the course of Gonorrhea and its various complications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>can be handled by a physician
only, as it requires a special equipment and
a special technic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Deep gonorrheal inflammation forbids
any instrumental treatment. With the first
symptoms pointing to its development, all
injections must stop until the acute stage
is over. The patient is advised to rest, and
is given some soothing internal medicine.
After two or three weeks the local treatment
may be resumed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Similarly to it is treated Acute Epididymitis
(inflammation of the testicle). With
the first signs of its development, all injections
must stop, and the patient has to
stay in bed until all acute swelling and pains
are gone, which takes usually from two to
three weeks. Locally, cold in the form of
ice bags, or heat with the hot-water bottle,
are used. They are both good, but in either
case the applications have to be kept up
persistently. Their selection depends upon
individual preference and feeling of relief
experienced by the patient. Locally, different
ointments are used to reduce and
soften the swelling.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Deep Gonorrhea can be cured only by
deep injections, with a special instrument
called <i>instillator</i>, of a few drops at a time
of strong germicide drugs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Extremely useful also and commonly
used are <i>irrigations</i> with a fountain syringe
of large quantities of antiseptic and soothing
solutions, which fill up the bladder and
effect a thorough flushing of the whole
urethral canal. These irrigations are used
under most variable conditions, and are
often used preceding or concluding instrumental
treatment. Their efficacy depends
on the systematic and persistent use and a
careful and exact grading of the strength of
the solutions.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Granulating patches</i> or row spots mentioned
above as the source and origin of
strictures can be <i>treated</i> only by <i>the urethroscope</i>
described before, by localizing them
and touching them up with cauterizing
medicines. This treatment is supplemented
by <i>stretching with the steel sounds</i> and irrigations.
The <i>treatment of strictures</i> is very
similar to this, and mainly consists of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span><i>stretching</i> with gradually increasing in size
<i>sounds and irrigations</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally, <i>Prostatitis is treated mainly by
massage of the prostrate gland</i>, which is done
by a finger inserted per rectum. This massage,
made once or twice a week, is one of
the most valuable parts of the treatment
of chronic Gonorrhea, because in no other
way can pus and gonococci be eliminated
and carried out from the deep recesses of
the gland as thru massage. Prostatic massage
is usually followed by instillations or
irrigations.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Prognosis (Probable Duration and Curability of Gonorrhea).</span></h3>

<p class='c015'><i>Treatment of all deep chronic complications
of Gonorrhea takes usually from two
to six months</i>, and sometimes longer if the
case is neglected. Patience and persistence
in treatment is an absolutely indispensable
condition for success, and patients who
take treatment for a while and then drop
it because, in their opinion, their case is
incurable are throwing away their only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>chance of cure. The fact of the matter is
that chronic Gonorrhea, if treated properly
and patiently, can be considered a thoroughly
curable disease. The incurable
cases make up not more than 5–10% of the
total number of cases properly treated, and
these few exceptions are usually neglected
old strictures, which of all Gonorrheal complications
are the hardest to cure.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Gonorrhea and Marriage.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>After the treatment of chronic Gonorrhea
is completed; after all visible signs
and symptoms have cleared up; after the
patient has resumed, with the permission of
his physician, his usual mode of life, a momentous
question comes up before the patient—when
can he marry with an absolute
assurance that he will not transmit his
sickness to his wife; in other words, when
can it be stated that he is absolutely cured?
That the answer on this question may
mean happiness or misery in life for the
patient is realized and recognized by all
intelligent people. But it seems to be unknown
and commonly overlooked that to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>give a positive and definite answer to this
question is a matter of great responsibility
and of greatest difficulty, even to the most
experienced and highly-trained specialist.
Only those who know how treacherous are
gonococci, what ability they have to lie
dormant for many months or even years in
the deep recesses of the body and then on
some provocation to waken up to new activity,
only those know how hard it is to
get the system rid of them, and how difficult
it is to be sure of their complete elimination.
And yet almost in all cases a physician
is able to tell with reasonable certainty
whether the patient is able to get married
without danger of transmitting the infection,
but to arrive at such a definite conclusion
a physician must undertake a whole
series of different examinations and special
tests, as only repeated, persistent, negative
tests for Gonococci can be accepted as conclusive.
A man who comes to a physician
and insists that the physician should render
his verdict at once demands the impossible,
and the hasty conclusion he will force out
is not worth much.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>
  <h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Urinalysis (Examination of the Urine).</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The first step in a series of examinations
to form an idea of the localization, intensity
of gonorrheal infection and to gauge the
results accomplished by the treatment is an
examination of the urine. Even a plain inspection
of the urine gives to the experienced
eye of the physician a pretty good idea of
the localization and intensity of the case.
To get the best results, the patient must
call early in the morning with the very
first urine kept in the bladder over night,
for the reason that the frequent voiding of
urine during the day continually washes out
the secretion, and thus masks the true
picture of the sickness. The physician inspects
the urine after it has been voided in
two or three glasses—so-called <i>two and
three glasses test</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>A systematic and repeated examination
of the urine is one of the most important
and healthful procedures in the treatment
of Gonorrhea, and no intelligent physician
can do without it. In this regard, a word
of warning should be addressed to the gonorrheal
patients. Let no one fall into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>error of playing physician in his own case
and try to look at his own urine at home,
drawing his own conclusions. This is surely
one of the occasions where a little knowledge
is worse than none. No matter how
intelligent a patient may be in other respects,
his attempts to gauge his condition
by the appearance of his urine will end disastrously
in blunders, causing unnecessary
worry and striking terror into his heart
without reason.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the most common mistakes of
this character is to regard the long shreds
swimming in the urine for pieces of tissue
which come, they imagine, from their decaying
organs, while the shreds are nothing
but the harmless mucous so-called <i>gonorrheal
threads</i>, and the longer these shreds
are and the more terrifying they appear to
the patient the more harmless they are.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another common and unnecessary scare
is due to a cloudy, dirty-looking urine, often
full of <i>sandy-like sediment</i> which in reality
is not a result of the sickness, but is produced
by harmless salts from certain food
or drugs. These two examples should be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>sufficient to show that for the best interests
of the patient the interpretations of the
symptoms of the disease should never be
attempted by themselves, but should be
left entirely to the physician.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next step after the inspection of the
urine is a <i>microscopical examination of the
discharge or a sediment from a urine</i>. This
test is the <i>most significant of all</i>. If a physician
finds under the microscope typical
gonococci even once from so many times,
the patient cannot be pronounced cured and
free from infection, no matter how well he
feels and how successful are all other tests.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a microscopical examination of the
discharge and of the sediment of the urine
is negative, i. e., gonococci are not found,
then the physician must secure thru massage
a <i>secretion of the prostrate gland</i> and
seminal vesicles and <i>examine</i> these fluids
<i>under a microscope for gonococci</i>. Even
this is not sufficient, and the search for hidden
gonococci can be made still more effective
by a <i>bacteriological test</i>, which consists
of producing an artificial growth of gonococci
from a discharge. This test is extremely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>sensitive, but it is complicated. To
assure still greater positiveness of the judgment,
a so-called <i>provocative test</i> can be used.
The patient is allowed not only to return
to his normal mode of life and unrestricted
regime, but for experiment’s sake is even
allowed an excessive indulgence in stimulating
food and drink. Here should be
mentioned the so-called “beer test,” which
is based on the fact that beer has a peculiar
irritating and stimulating influence on gonococci,
bringing them from the deep recesses
to the surface, where they can be
easily found on microscopical examination.</p>

<p class='c007'>If all these tests are uniformly negative,
then the patient can consider himself cured
and free from infection, and can be allowed
to marry. But <i>if a single one of these
tests are positive, that is, shows the presence
of gonococci, and the rest of the tests are
negative, then the case is still under suspicion
and requires further watching or treatment</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is proper to state, tho, that in certain
cases a man may be allowed to marry even
before he is perfectly cured from all after-results
or complications of Gonorrhea. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>is particularly true in regard to strictures,
chronic prostatitis, or hard nodules remaining
in the testicles after Epididymitis. The
reason for this allowance is that the contagious
stage of Gonorrhea does not last
always thruout  the whole course of the disease.
Quite often the gonococci are dying
out before the after-results and different
inflammatory conditions (that were originally
started by gonococci, but later were
kept up by other germs always present in
the genito-urinary tract) are cured. Therefore
if a physician, after having tried all the
above-described tests, is satisfied that there
are no more gonococci present and detectable,
and that the condition as yet uncured,
such, for example, as a stricture which carries
no germs and precludes every possibility
of transmitting infection, then he can conscientiously
allow the patient to get married,
if marriage, for some personal reasons,
can not be delayed. At the present stage
of medical science the tests establishing the
fact of perfect cure of Gonorrhea is a time-consuming
and complicated procedure, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>considering the responsibility involved both
for the patient and the physician, no intelligent
man should fail to go through it, if it
should fall to his lot to do so.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>Functional Sexual Diseases.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>After briefly reviewing the problem of
Gonorrhea in its different aspects, we shall
discuss certain conditions which stand in
very near relation to Gonorrhea. There
are: <i>Impotence</i>, known under the common
name of loss of manhood; <i>sterility</i>, loss of
procreative power; and <i>sexual neurasthenia</i>,
nervous debility developed on sexual ground.
While these conditions may also develop
independently without any Gonorrhea in
the history, from other abuses and irregularities
in the sexual sphere, yet in a very
large number of cases they do develop, if
not because of Gonorrhea, at least after it;
in other words, Gonorrhea, by weakening
general and specially sexual nervous apparatus,
creates a certain predisposition for
their development.</p>

<p class='c007'>These diseases are worthy of serious
consideration, as they are very widespread and
are the cause of many unhappy homes,
of untold family tragedies, and of much individual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>and moral suffering. These diseases
do not cause physical pains, neither
are they dangerous to life, but men afflicted
with them feel so miserable, suffer such
agonies of moral anguish, are so depressed
in spirit and so despaired of life that they
would prefer any acute pain or welcome any
operation to relieve their misery.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Impotence.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Impotence, as mentioned above, is an
inability to perform a normal sexual intercourse.
The indispensable physical condition
for a normal sexual intercourse is an
erect position (erection of the penis) and a
normal period of time before a seminal ejaculation
takes place; hence Impotentia can
be manifested either by partial or total
power of erection, or premature ejaculation,
or both. According to various causes leading
to loss of erective power, three various
kinds of Impotence should be considered—psychic,
irritable, and paralytic.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Psychic impotence</i> is a very peculiar
condition strikingly illustrating a powerful
influence of the mind over bodily functions.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>It usually attacks young men in perfect
health who are of a worrying and brooding
disposition, particularly so over sexual matters.
They may have on their conscience
the guilt of having indulged in masturbation
years ago, or they may have had a
gonorrheal infection some time before. As
a result of this brooding over the sins of
their youth, they work themselves into a
suggestion that they have ruined their system
and have lost their sexual power, and
such is the power of self-suggestion that in
spite of perfect health and the absence of
any abnormal condition, all attempts at
normal intercourse end in dismal failure,
which in the case of newly-married people
is naturally a very grave and distressing
occurrence. Ordinarily these cases get well
after a certain period of time under the influence
and care of a physician without any
local treatment, but under general tonic
regime. The main danger of these cases is
that this class of cases fall particularly easy
prey to medical quack healers, who exploit
the ignorant and terror-stricken victims to
the limit of their ability to pay, by intensifying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>their fear and curing them from non-existing
terrible diseases.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Irritative Impotence.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The second type of <i>Impotence</i>, <i>irritative</i>,
is the most frequent of all. In this
condition the power of erection may or may
not be affected, but the main distressing
feature is a <i>premature ejaculation of seminal
fluid</i>, which may take place even before
a man approaches the woman. This condition
is caused by over-stimulation and
over-irritation of the sexual nervous apparatus,
and is mostly the result either of an
old habit of masturbation (self-abuse) or a
chronic inflammation in the deep urethra
left after previous Gonorrhea. This class
of patients is also suffering from <i>frequent
night emissions</i> and <i>general nervosity</i>. They
constitute the most pitiful and miserable
group of all venereal cases. Weak and
haggard-looking from loss of seminal fluid,
broken in spirit as well as in body, they are
haunted by a feeling of despair and utter
annihilation; they are full of disgust with
themselves, and are frequently incapable of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>pursuing their occupation. This class of
men, as all the Impotentia cases, also fall
easy prey to medical quacks, as they are
often ashamed to go to a regular practitioner
and family physician, and prefer to
go to a stranger. Fortunately these cases
are not difficult to cure, though it takes
usually several months to effect a permanent
cure. The treatment will vary according
to the cause producing this hyperirritability
of the nervous apparatus. It
may require treatment <a id='t118'></a>of the deep urethra,
prostate gland, or general tonic regime.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Spermatorrhea (Involuntary Loss of Seminal Fluid).</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>A common and one of the most distressing
features of irritative impotence is <i>Spermatorrhea</i>,
i. e., an involuntary loss of the
seminal fluid, outside of night emissions.
These seminal losses occur either as periodical
oozing of a few drops at the end of
urination and defecation, or as continual
oozing as a result of muscular weakness
and insufficient contraction of prostatic
ducts. This continually oozing fluid is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>usually prostatic secretion, and is due to
the existing chronic prostatitis. The cure
of this condition is effected thru the treatment
of the prostate gland.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Urorrhea (Wetness from Dribbling and Oozing of Clear Watery Discharge).</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>It should be mentioned here that there
is another condition resembling very much
the above-described Spermatorrhea, a condition
that scares the patients very much,
who think they are suffering from seminal
losses. This condition, Urorrhea, is very
harmless, as the secretion oozing in these
cases is plain water and mucus, due to excessive
blood congestion in time of sexual
excitement. But the difference between
these two fluids and two conditions can be
established only by a physician on microscopical
examination, and should not be
left to the judgment of the patient himself.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Paralytic Impotence.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The last variety of impotence, Paralytic,
presents a condition opposite that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>just described, and instead of irritation and
over-stimulation of the nervous sexual apparatus,
it shows its weakness and exhaustion
down to complete paralysis.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is understood that every man reaching
a certain age gradually declines in
vigor of sexual power. This age of sexual
decline varies considerably with different
people, from the ages of 45–70, depending
on general health, and still more on the
mode of life. This much is sure: that <i>men
who have led a regular and moderate sexual
life and have married early retain their
sexual power a good deal longer than men
who have dissipated and indulged in various
excesses</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paralytic impotence may mean either
complete loss of erection or partial. Most
common causes of paralytic impotence in
young men are a persistent and excessive
masturbation habit and excessive sexual indulgence.
The earlier in life these vicious
habits and excesses are started and the
longer they last, the harder and harder is the
cure of the resulting sexual exhausting impotence.
In fact, these cases are the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>difficult of all to cure, and many of them
are incurable. Men suffering with paralytic
impotence present a truly pitiful picture.
They lose every ambition in life, lose their
energy and force of personality, lose mental
and physical vigor and endurance, and become
mere wrecks and shadows of their
old selves. If boys and young men could
only see these victims of their own ignorance
and folly as the physician sees them
in their desperate and hopeless fight to
regain their lost manhood, surely thousands
and thousands of young, happy lives could
be saved to themselves and to society.</p>

<p class='c007'>The treatment consists in general and
local tonic treatment.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Sterility (Inability to have Children).</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The foundation of society is a happy
family and home life. The foundation of
a happy home life is children. No home
can be happy without the sunshine of the
little ones, who are the dearest gifts of
Nature to mankind. No marriage can be
happy unless it fulfills its natural mission
and reaches its full fruition by perpetuating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the race of the parents thru children. The
children are the greatest and most powerful
incentive and inspiration for a man to work
and to strive for a greater success in his
chosen line. Children are a life mission and
a life interest of a woman; they are the
strongest and purest bonds of love between
a man and a woman. Gloom and emptiness
prevail in a home that is not blessed with
children; there is no living interest and no
natural attraction in such a home, and a
childless couple is doomed to seek outside
distractions and interests to fill up the
natural void in their existence and to forget
their heart-hunger.</p>

<p class='c007'>No man who looks forward to a happy
family life in the future can ignore the question
and shirk the responsibility of producing
healthy children. And yet so many
men, thru light-mindedness or ignorance in
younger years, are responsible for the
tragedy of a barren home later in life, when
it is too late to retrace their steps and to
redeem their sins of youth. Public opinion
commonly puts the blame on the woman
for being childless, and only in exceptional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>cases considers the possibility of the man
being responsible for it. How unjust and
how far from the truth! The inability to
bear children, medically known as <i>sterility</i>,
in a very large number of cases, at least
half, is directly or indirectly due to a man’s
disease or an inborn defect. Leaving aside
a rather small group of cases, where a
woman is unable to bear children due to
some inborn defect or disease, the largest
class of cases of sterility is due to venereal
poisons, Gonorrhea, or Syphilis contracted
from their husbands. In Gonorrhea, due to
chronic inflammation of organs of procreation
or mutilating operations—necessary in
these cases—no conception is possible. In
Syphilis, conception is possible, but a
woman is unable to bear living children.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the cases of direct <i>male sterility</i>, the
woman is perfectly healthy, and the fault
lies with the man alone. It may be due
either to some inborn anatomical defect, or,
what is infinitely more common, to some
venereal disease. In these cases, the male
embryos-spermatozoa are either absent or
unable to travel in normal channels and to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>penetrate in the female organs. This inability
may be due to a different cause; <i>the
most common cause</i> of all is Gonorrhea, or,
more exactly, a <i>gonorrheal epididymitis</i>.
As mentioned above, Epididymitis, if uncured,
often leaves behind hard nodules
which obliterate and obstruct the spermatic
channel, partially or completely, thus blocking
and preventing spermatozoa from passing
from the testicles, where they are produced
thru the urethral canal out of the body.
A man who has had Epididymitis, with the
complete obstruction of the spermatic channel
only on one side, may yet have children,
but if the obstruction is on both sides, he
becomes absolutely sterile.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another cause of male sterility, tho not
as common, are strictures, which, by obstructing
and twisting the urethral canal,
may divert or weaken ejaculation of spermatozoa
in such a way as to make conception
impossible. It may happen also that
tho all channels for the passage of spermatozoa
are free, the spermatozoa themselves,
due to a sexual or general exhaustion,
are either missing or are of such low vitality
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>as to give no hopes for living or healthy
children.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every man with a history of a venereal
disease should have his seminal secretion
examined under microscope before his marriage,
to test its vitality. The knowledge
of these facts and the application of these
principles in practical life by the average
man could save thousands of happy homes
and prevent as many divorces.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Sexual Neurasthenia.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The last complication to be developed
in the course of Gonorrhea, but not by any
means the last in importance, is sexual neurasthenia;
i. e., a chronic state of nervous
and mental weakness and irritability. Possibly
no other condition illustrates so well
how far and deep-reaching is the influence
of Gonorrhea on the whole system, tho it is
a local disease; how thoroughly it affects
the entire mental and nervous system of a
man; how much moral anguish and suffering
it inflicts on its victims. The reason for
such a powerful effect of Gonorrhea on the
human mind and emotions has been explained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>before by the fact that the genito-urinary
tract and different sexual glands
which are usually affected by Gonorrhea are
richly supplied with nerves and are most
intimately and abundantly connected thru
these nerves with the highest centers of the
nervous system, controlling the mental and
emotional activities.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been mentioned already that the
nervous weakness can be brought about
by various sexual abuses and irregularities,
such as the masturbation habit, sexual excesses,
or over-stimulated and ungratified
desire, but the cases following in the wake
of chronic Gonorrhea and its complications
are so numerous, so persistent, and distressing
as to deserve special prominence and
consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sexual Neurasthenia develops as a rule
slowly, and it comes either during the treatment
or long after Gonorrhea has been
cured. The predisposition to this condition
is created by excessive worrying and brooding
over the disease, and the basis of sexual
Neurasthenia constitutes an idea slowly
formed and fixed in the mind of the patient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>that he is “full of disease,” and that his
condition is incurable. As a result of this
self-suggestion and constant concentration
of his mind on different parts of the body,
he feels, or rather he thinks he feels, an
endless variety of different painful and morbid
sensations. There is not a single spot
on his body, there is not a single kind of
pain or discomfort that should not be complained
of by this class of patients. It does
not matter whether his case is improving
or even cured and does not show a single
positive symptom of the disease, the patient
cannot be won over to the cheerful view of
his condition. No amount of argument or
persuasion on the part of the physician avails
to shake off his gloom and despair. If the
physician, after a careful examination, states
to a sexual neurasthenic that he does not
need any more treatment, the patient accuses
the physician of being indifferent, and not
taking sufficient interest in his case and goes
elsewhere. If the physician yields to the
pleadings of the patient and keeps up an
active treatment, that makes matters only
worse, and still more confirms the patient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>of the deep and dangerous character of his
condition. The only way to break the
eternal chain of fear and anxiety, which is
the main basis of sexual neurasthenia, is to
turn the mind of the patient away from his
sickness by stopping treatment, sending him
away, if possible, from old associations and
surroundings, and by building up his general
and nervous system. The treatment of
this condition lasts several months, but they
all recover in due course of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>This class of patients, in their frantic
search for a cure from the imaginary sickness,
are naturally more exposed to the
danger of drifting away into the hands of
medical quacks, and are more exploited
than any other class of venereal patients.
A sympathetic attitude on the part of the
physician and evidence of his sincere and
earnest interest in the condition of the patient
is the only thing that slowly gains the
confidence of sexual neurasthenics, brings
them back courage, ease of mind, and restores
them to a healthy and happy life.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>Chancroid</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Now before going over the greatest of
all venereal scourges, Syphilis, we shall
briefly consider the third and the least dangerous
of the venereal diseases—Chancroid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Chancroid is also called a <i>soft chancre</i>,
to differentiate it from <i>hard chancre</i>, which
is the initial sore of Syphilis.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Chancroid usually appears from two to
five days after exposure</i>, seldom longer. It
may develop on the skin of any part of the
sexual organs. It starts as a small red spot
or pimple, which rapidly breaks down and
forms a round ulcer, painful on touch, with
undermined borders and profusely secreting
pus surface. Chancroid may start at
once as a multiple ulcer or it may grow in
numbers after it has started as a single sore.
The number of Chancroids may reach five,
ten, or even more. The peculiar characteristic
of Chancroid is that its poison can be
transferred from one place to another by
contact, and it is a common clinical fact,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>particularly in uncleanly and careless people,
that a single Chancroid or ulcer may
duplicate itself on the skin surface that
comes in contact with the Chancroid.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Chancroid is usually painful</i> and disables
a man to a smaller or greater extent,
so for this reason it is seldom neglected.
Under proper care, Chancroid <i>heals up in
from three to six weeks</i>. Only in exceptional
cases, due to low vitality and general
debility of the patient, or due to unusual
virulence (intensity) of the Chancroidal poison,
the Chancroidal ulcer assumes a gangrenous
character, and in spite of the best
treatment, shows a tendency to spread and
to destroy a large area of tissue. But even
in these rare cases, after a few weeks or
months, the ulcerated area gradually heals
up without leaving any permanent systemic
damage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The only complication Chancroid has is
a development of bubo, an abscess of inguinal
(groin) glands. <i>Buboes</i> develop in
about half the Chancroidal cases, and are
treated by incision on general surgical principles.
The average duration of a bubo is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>from three to four weeks, and the total duration
of the average Chancroid and bubo
from six to eight weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>While Chancroid brings more pain and
distress and disables a patient more than
many Gonorrheal complications and average
Syphilitic cases, in reality, Chancroid
is the least harmful of all venereal diseases,
as it has a self-limited duration, never penetrates
into the blood, does not lead to any
deep or constitutional complication, and
does not affect whatsoever the second generation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>Syphilis</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Syphilis is one of the oldest diseases in
human history. Its ravages and destruction
of health and life thruout many centuries
up to our days have been such that
it has been called a “black plague,” in distinction
from the great “white plague,”
tuberculosis. It is hard to say which one of
the scourges of humanity is superior in its
destruction and wrecking of humanity.
While tuberculosis apparently carries away
more lives in their prime and selects victims
principally among the young at the very
height of individual happiness and social
usefulness, Syphilis surpasses its terrible
rival in its universal character of distribution,
in the easier mode of infection, and
more lasting presence of the poison in the
human body. No country or climate is free
from the scourge of Syphilis. No age, no
station of life gives protection from its infection.
Syphilis claims its millions of victims
in all parts of the universe. It has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>populated cemeteries with untold numbers
of bodies of still-born babies and infants
who died in the early months of life; it has
filled the insane asylums of the world with
thousands of hopelessly insane men and
women; it has crowded the institutions for
the incurable and defective with paralytic
adults and children crippled mentally and
physically from birth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The individual suffers as much from the
ravages of Syphilis as society. Lucky is the
man who can say that he is perfectly cured
from Syphilis after two or three years of the
most thorough treatment. Lucky is the
man if he can be sure that later in life, after
he may have forgotten all about his primary
infection, the dormant germs of Syphilis
lurking in the deep recesses of his body
will not attack his most vital organs, as
arteries, heart, or brain, and will not strike
him down to permanent invalidism or slow
but hopeless agony of an incurable disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>Great as the latest medical discoveries
in the recognition and treatment are, the
course of the disease is so insidious and
treacherous, and the treatment requires such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>persistence and patience and such expenditure
of time and money, that probably no
more than half of the syphilitic patients
carry out to the end the treatment and
period of medical observation, and thousands
and thousands of them are sure to be
stricken down later in life with the above
mentioned terrible after-complications of
Syphilis, and are doomed to premature invalidism,
paralytic diseases, and insanity.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Diagnosis (Recognition) of Syphilis.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>In every disease an early and correct
diagnosis is an essential condition for a successful
treatment. This is particularly true
in Syphilis. The early recognition of Syphilis
can prevent a development of most dangerous
complications, can forestall the destruction
of most vital nervous centers and
organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The recognition of Syphilis is beset with
peculiar difficulties, due to the fact that
Syphilis has a remarkable tendency to imitate
in appearance all possible diseases.
This simulation is rendered particularly
effective because Syphilis has universal and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>all-pervading distribution in the human
body, and not a single part, organ, or tissue
is free from the invasion of syphilitic poison.
Until lately the diagnosis of Syphilis was
based on the rather uncertain basis of
clinical experience, but the latest medical
discoveries have put it upon a more definite
foundation, and rendered it immeasurably
more certain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first step in this direction was the
discovery by a French scientist, Shaudin,
of a germ producing Syphilis, a germ that
he has called <i>Spirocheta pallida</i>. Spirocheta
under the microscope looks very much like
a corkscrew, and can be easily demonstrated
in all fresh Syphilis sores. A finding of
Spirocheta at once and absolutely establishes
a diagnosis of Syphilis. Another valuable
method by which a doubtful or latent
case of Syphilis can be recognized is a
<i>blood test</i>, known by the name of its discoverer
as <i>Wasserman Test</i>. This is a very
complicated test, requiring a highly-developed
technic, and it can be properly done
only in specially equipped laboratories.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Wasserman test is not as absolutely
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>sure and positive as finding of Spirocheta,
yet it is very useful, and indeed indispensable
in many cases of latent Syphilis, i. e.,
Syphilis that does not show any active
symptoms like sores, breaking out, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is one more way to test the blood
for Syphilis—<i>luetin test</i>, discovered by a
Japanese scientist, Noguchi. Luetin test
is made by injection in the skin of a certain
substance, and also is very useful in old
and latent cases of Syphilis. Recognition
of Syphilis by the appearance and character
of the sores and skin eruptions is in many
cases very difficult, and can be done in
doubtful cases only by a physician specially
trained in this class of diseases.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Clinical Course of Syphilis.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The clinical course of Syphilis is usually
divided, for the sake of convenience of
presentation, into three periods.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Primary Period of Syphilis.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The first manifestation of Syphilis in
the human body is a primary syphilitic sore,
so-called <i>hard chancre</i>. This chancre <i>appears
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>usually two or three weeks after exposure</i>,
and this is a very important point
to remember. Most men think that every
venereal disease shows up a day or two
after intercourse, and if a week passes without
any signs of infection, they congratulate
themselves upon having escaped the
penalty of the transgression. Therefore
when, two or three weeks after the exposure,
they notice a small pimple or nodule
on the genital organs, they ascribe it to
some accidental cause, and never think of
the possibility of it being of a venereal
nature. This error of judgment is rendered
particularly easy by the fact that the initial
syphilitic sore has such a harmless, insignificant
appearance, and is commonly so
free from any pain, discomfort, or acute
distress, that the patient, as a rule, ignores
it, believing it will pass away by itself, or
applies some ordinary salve. Only after
they see that this “pimple” does not disappear,
and gets harder and bigger in size,
only then they become alarmed and consult
a physician. This is the reason that so
many patients present themselves to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>physician when the syphilitic poison has
already spread all over the body and has
broken out in a general eruption.</p>

<p class='c007'>A deceiving appearance and mild clinical
course of primary syphilitic chancre that
gives to a patient a false feeling of security
cannot be too strongly emphasized and
warned against. The following injunction
seems to be well indicated to all men taking
chances with venereal infection: <i>Beware of
the little, painless, insignificant pimple on
the genital organs, that comes up two or
three weeks after exposure and shows a tendency
to become firm and hard on touch.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Primary syphilitic chancre may look
like a plain pimple or swelling without any
sore on it, or it may present a greasy-looking
ulcer with a very slight discharge,
but all syphilitic chancres have <i>one characteristic
feature</i> always present; this is a
hard, almost wooden feel and <i>firm consistence
on touch</i>.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Syphilitic Buboes.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Shortly after the appearance of primary
chancre the patient notices a swelling of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the glands in the groin on one or both sides,
which feel like hard nuts, <i>syphilitic buboes</i>.
These buboes never turn into an abscess,
and remain hard for many, many months,
until, under treatment, they slowly go
down.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Mixed Chancre.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The fact that a man two or three days
after an exposure begins to show a sore of
Chancroidal type does not mean that he is
already safe from developing a syphilitic
chancre besides. In fact, it is a quite common
occurrence that after development of
typical Chancroid, in a week or two this
sore begins to change in appearance and
turns gradually into a syphilitic chancre.
In other words, this man has contracted a
double infection of both chancres, only
their appearance takes place at different
times, according to the difference in the
length of time of their periods of incubation.
The treatment of these mixed cases
is naturally of more complicated character.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>
  <h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Secondary Period of Syphilis.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>The secondary period of Syphilis begins
with the first evidence that the syphilitic
poison has spread all over the body, and
that Syphilis from a local sore has become
constitutional-blood disease. It takes usually
about <i>six weeks</i> from the time of appearance
of the primary chancre until the
development of the constitutional symptoms.
The very first symptom of the constitutional
syphilis is a general rash, which
has such a peculiar appearance that no
competent physician has any difficulty in
recognizing its nature. Together with the
skin eruption, so-called “<i>mucous plaques</i>”
can be seen in the throat, on the tongue,
lips, etc. Very often syphilitics of the secondary
period suffer from attacks of fever
and get rapidly run down and wasted. In
fact, an experienced physician can recognize
a syphilitic by a peculiar paleness and
general appearance suggesting slow waste
of the body by some chronic poison.</p>

<p class='c007'>The most common complaints in the
secondary period of Syphilis are: Severe
headaches and boring pains in the bones,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>particularly at night; different skin eruptions
and patches of mucous plaques around
the mouth or genital organs. These mucous
plaques contain millions of active spirochetae,
and for this reason the <i>secondary
period of Syphilis is the most dangerous
period for transmission of the infection</i>. The
secondary period may last from a few
months to one to two years, depending on
the gravity of the case and the character of
treatment.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Tertiary Period of Syphilis.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The tertiary period of Syphilis is the
longest in duration and the most dangerous
stage of the disease. It gradually succeeds
the secondary active period of Syphilis and
lasts, if not treated thoroughly, for many
years, and sometimes thru the entire life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The main characteristic of this period is
that its lesions (sores) are fewer, but they
are very deep and penetrate to the most
vital and important organs, such as blood
vessels, heart, spinal cord, and brain. This
is the time when syphilitic germs, after a
long period of apparent cure of the disease,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>suddenly renew their destructive activity
and strike down their victim with some
permanently crippling and incurable chronic
disease. It has been mentioned before that
Syphilis does not spare a single part or
organ or tissue of the body. Anywhere, in
the deepest recesses of the most vital and
life-bearing centers of the body, a tumor of
tertiary Syphilis can form, so-called <i>Gumma</i>,
that has a natural tendency to break down,
forming an ulcer and leading to a terrible
destruction of tissues.</p>

<p class='c007'>We shall not tire the reader by a detailed
description of the possible results of this
destruction of the body; it is sufficient to
say that death is a welcome relief to the
crippled, palsied, and insane victims of advanced
Tertiary Syphilis. We shall mention
only two diseases that are definitely
proven to be after-results of Syphilis—diseases
that are both incurable and that
count as their victims countless thousands
of men all over the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first, a <i>progressive paralysis</i>, a
chronic, progressively increasing insanity,
that draws out for many years and invariably
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>ends fatally, after a long agony of
physical and mental decay and waste.</p>

<p class='c007'>The second disease is <i>Locomotor Ataxia</i>, a
chronic, slowly-spreading decay of the spinal
cord, in which are located the most important
nerves controlling the sensation and
locomotion of the body. As the result of
the slow death of these nerves, a man is
gradually transformed into a helpless and
hopeless paralytic, doomed to stay bedridden
for life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any and all complications of Tertiary
Syphilis can arise and strike down a man in
a most insidious and unexpected manner.
The most dangerous and deceiving feature
of syphilitic lesions is that they develop
painlessly and without acute distress or
discomfort to the patient, who becomes
aware of the disease only after a considerable
amount of tissue is destroyed and irreparable
damage has been done. No man
who has a syphilitic chancre is safe from a
possibility of development of complications
of Tertiary Syphilis unless his blood,
after repeated tests, has been pronounced
pure and free from syphilitic poisons.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>
  <h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Hereditary Syphilis.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c015'>Nowhere else are the ravages of Syphilis
more destructive and cruel; no other disease
punishes the offspring for the sins of its
parents so ruthlessly and wantonly; no
other scourge inflicts its terrible retribution
on the second generation at such a tender
age as hereditary Syphilis. Hereditary
Syphilis is undoubtedly the saddest and
most gruesome chapter in the long black
record of Syphilis.</p>

<p class='c007'>The offspring <i>may inherit Syphilis from
his father</i> thru sperma (semen), <i>from his
mother</i> thru ovum and blood circulation,
or it may get infection <i>from both parents</i>
at once. Most of the cases are due to infection
from the father. Fortunately, experience
has shown that the older the case
of Syphilis is, and the better it has been
treated, the more chance the offspring has
to escape a syphilitic heredity, and the
milder will the infection be if it be inherited.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a man in the active stage of Syphilis
marries a healthy woman, whether she herself
be infected or not, she will not bear living
children for a certain period of time.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>The first two or three years she will miscarry
in the early months of pregnancy, a truly
merciful provision on the part of nature, as
death is certainly preferable to the drawn-out
agony of the little creature, mutilated
and crippled from birth. A little later the
wife of a syphilitic is able to carry children
to a full term, but they are born with the
indelible stamp of loathsome heredity on
their dwarfed bodies. The appearance of
such children is as pitiful as it is repulsive.
Wizened, old-looking faces, stunted bodies,
numerous sores and skin eruptions, bone
deformities, soft joints, due to decaying of
bone ends and skulls distended with water;
these and many other defects are the legacy
these innocent victims come into the world
with. Naturally, the vitality of such children
is so low that many of them die in early
infancy. Yet some of them can be saved
by an early and thorough treatment. The
farther it goes the more healthy-looking
children are born, the fewer evidences of
syphilitic heredity they present, and the
later in life these evidences develop. Gradually,
as the father or both parents receive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>proper treatment, their offspring born are
more and more healthy and free from taint.
<i>There is no question whatsoever that syphilitic
parents, one or both, can have, after they have
cured themselves, perfectly healthy children,
physically and mentally free from any blood
taint or possibility of later relapses.</i></p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Treatment of Syphilis.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>It is remarkable that while modern science
has introduced hundreds of new drugs
for different diseases, Syphilis, with one exception,
is still treated with the same drug
that was used centuries ago; <i>this drug is
mercury</i>; the only thing that has changed
is the method of administration. Mercury,
or rather its different salts, are used now in
a number of ways. It can be used internally,
in powders, pills, and mixtures; hypodermically,
intradermically, thru inunctions (rubs
into the skin), intramuscularly, and even
intravenously. Which particular method
and which particular salt of mercury is to
be preferred, depends on the judgment of
the physician and the character of the case.
The main condition of the success of treatment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>is not the selection of this or the
other method of treatment, but in the
thoroughness, persistence, and systematic
use of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mercury is proven to be an excellent
germicide, and it cures Syphilis by killing
its germs—Spirochetae.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Salvarsan—606.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>Until very recent days mercury was
our only anchor sheet in the fight against
Syphilis, but in 1910 the great German scientist,
Professor Paul Ehrlich, discovered
that a certain chemical combination of arsenic,
called by him <i>Salvarsan</i>, has a wonderful
germicide effect on Spirocheta of
Syphilis. Salvarsan is known also as 606,
and its latest modification, Neo Salvarsan,
is known as No. 914, because Ehrlich had
to re-examine 605 different combinations of
arsenic before he has developed and adopted
606, and he had to re-examine 913 combinations
before he has adopted No. 914. At
the time of its discovery the greatest enthusiasm
prevailed, and it was claimed and
expected by many that one injection of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Salvarsan would be able to kill all the
spirochetae in the body, and thus bring
about a complete cure of Syphilis. Unfortunately,
subsequent experience has shown
that these expectations were unfounded.
Salvarsan is a great remedy and one injection
of it may heal up very rapidly most
destructive syphilitic lesions, but neither
one injection nor two nor three can with
certainty produce a perfect and absolute
cure of Syphilis.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>General Treatment and Regime in Syphilis.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The consensus of opinion of the most
reliable and competent of medical observers
at the present time is that the best results
in the treatment of Syphilis are obtained
by combined use of mercury and salvarsan,
beginning with a few injections of Salvarsan
and following up with a thorough mercurial
treatment. The great usefulness and striking
healing properties of Salvarsan in
Syphilis are particularly to be appreciated,
because mercury is not tolerated by many
patients beyond a certain limit. Push beyond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>this limit, mercury produces symptoms
of <i>mercurialism</i>—chronic mercurial
poisoning, manifested by swollen and painful
gums, bad smell from the mouth, stomach
disorders, diarrhea, etc., which may
prove serious and even dangerous. One of
the most important measures of prevention
of mercurialism in a patient undergoing
mercurial treatment is to keep the mouth
and teeth in a clean and healthy condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>One more drug should be mentioned,
which, besides mercury and Salvarsan, is
used more than any other drug in the treatment
of Syphilis. This drug is Potassium
Iodide, which is very useful and surpasses
anything else in its remarkable quality to
absorb deep-seated syphilitic tumors (gummata)
of the tertiary period.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides these three drugs, which are
called <i>specific</i>, because their action is almost
infallible, there are very few drugs
used in Syphilis, mostly tonics to build up
and strengthen the system, weakened by
syphilitic poison. The general regime in
Syphilis is much more liberal than in Gonorrhea,
both as to choice of food and drink
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>and as to the permissible amount of physical
exercise or pleasure. This is particularly
true in the late tertiary period of
Syphilis. In the acute secondary stage of
the disease, moderation and a regular mode
of life is absolutely essential for the favorable
course of the disease. The use of alcoholic
liquors at this stage is absolutely
prohibited, but it is tolerated in moderation
if no active symptoms are present. Smoking
and chewing are also prohibited if any
sores or patches are present in the mouth.
As mentioned before, these mouth patches,
as the sores of this period, are highly contagious,
and the patient, for the sake of
others, must have his own table utensils
and all articles of personal use. He is also
cautioned to avoid in every possible way a
close physical touch with others.</p>

<h3 class='c014'><span class='sc'>Syphilis and Marriage.</span></h3>

<p class='c015'>The question, when can a syphilitic
marry? is as momentous and difficult to
answer as a similar question in Gonorrhea;
in other words, this question means, When
can a syphilitic be declared perfectly cured
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>and free from any danger of transmitting
the infection to his wife and children?
Until very recent years, before the three
great discoveries in the realm of Syphilis
had been made (the discovery of Spirocheta,
Wasserman blood test, and Salvarsan),
the physicians adopted from experience
a rule which proved to hold good in the
majority of cases. This rule reads that no
syphilitic should be allowed to marry before
three years passed since the time of
primary infection. This rule was adopted
on the assumption that the effects of
three years’ treatment and the natural
weakening of the virulence (intensity) of
the syphilitic poison with the age of the
disease give a reasonable assurance of
safety to the wife and offspring. It is
true that in most of the cases the family
was fairly well protected by the long duration
of observation period, and remained
free from the infection, yet the physician
had no exact and definite basis for such
prediction, and while the family was well,
some of these men developed many years
later various dangerous and incurable complications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>of the advanced Tertiary Syphilis.
Fortunately, now, in the light of new
knowledge at our command about Syphilis,
we are able to gauge the condition of the
patient as to the degree of his cure of Syphilis
in a very exact and definite manner.
One test, tho, is not conclusive, particularly
if it be negative. Positive Wasserman test
is a fairly good evidence that syphilitic
germs, spirochetae, are still present in the
body in a dormant, if not an active, state,
but a negative test, to be conclusive, must
be repeated several times, covering a long
period of time under various conditions,
such as before and after a course of treatment.
It should be remembered that while
different active lesions in Syphilis are controlled
and cleared up under modern methods
of treatment very rapidly, a perfect
elimination of spirochetae from the system
is much more difficult, and it is always a
time-consuming procedure. There are many
cases of Syphilis where, after the primary
general rash, sore throat, and other symptoms
of the early secondary period, no other
active symptoms of any kind develop subsequently,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>so that the actual manifestations
of Syphilis are limited to a very few weeks
or months, but even in these cases should a
blood test be persistently negative for a
period of half a year’s time, at least another
half year should elapse before a final
blood test is made. In the mildest and
most thoroughly treated cases, a year’s time
should be the shortest waiting period for
giving a permission of marriage. In many
more cases, probably in the majority, this
period must be extended to two or three
years, and in a few cases of malignant or
destructive character, even much longer
than this.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the modern methods of treatment
have shortened enormously the period of
active manifestation of Syphilis, and have
placed in our hands powerful means to control
and to check the most malignant and
destructive syphilitic lesions, but the period
of quarantine in regard to marriage is not
shortened very much, though its estimation
is made immeasurably more certain, definite,
and reliable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Syphilis can be considered at the present
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>time as <i>perfectly curable and readily amenable
to treatment</i>, provided a correct and
early diagnosis is made and a thorough,
systematic, and persistent treatment is administered.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>Conclusion.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The foregoing pages are offered to the
reader with the purpose of presenting a
short and popular exposition of the subject
of sex knowledge, immense in its scope
and tremendous in its social importance,
and to give in the simplest and briefest
possible terms the most fundamental and
important facts from a practical viewpoint
of the sex life in health and disease. The
conclusions to be drawn will naturally vary
with the mental and moral capacity of the
reader.</p>

<p class='c007'>The writer does not want to force his
personal opinion on the reader, and his intention
is to present only the facts of the
sex life as they are viewed by medical science
of our day, and as they appear from his
personal observation. The writer reserves,
however, a privilege to define his position
and attitude on the question of social
purity. His views, based upon personal
and theoretical grounds, would be:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>First.—That sexual abstinence can be
enforced with perfect ease and without any
harmful consequences until the full development
of physical and sexual maturity,
which is about from 22–25 years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Second.—That venereal diseases and various
sexual disorders are entirely too big a
price to be paid for a momentary impulse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Third.—That the only proper and normal
solution of the sexual problem for a
man above the age of sexual maturity is—marriage.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fourth.—That the sexual “<i>necessity</i>” in
young men under the age of sexual maturity
is <i>always</i>, and in men sexually mature,
<i>frequently</i>, a self-suggested notion,
artificially stimulated by indulgence and
environment, and allowed to grow and
persist thru the lack of self-control.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fifth.—That the amount of social waste
and individual damage caused by venereal
diseases can be reduced to a minimum by
spreading among men and maturing boys
the elementary knowledge of the facts of
sex life in health and disease.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>Questionnaire</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Question 1.—Is sexual continence harmful
to health?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—At the age before full sexual
maturity, that is, up to 22–25 years, sexual
continence is not only not harmful, but
even advisable and extremely effective in
keeping up the physical and mental freshness
and full vigor of a growing body. After
full sexual maturity is reached, a regular
sexual life thru marriage is desirable, but
even at this age sexual continence can be
kept up for many months without the slightest
harm to the individual whatsoever, provided
he keeps away from unnecessary
stimulating and exciting influences.</p>

<p class='c007'>Question 2.—Are the pimples on the face
of young men an indication of the necessity
of sexual intercourse?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—Not at all. The pimples on
the face of young people is a harmless skin
disease known under the name of <i>Acne</i>,
and is due to the surplus of fat secreted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>by the young skin, but it has nothing
to do with the sexual function. It is just
as much and to an equal degree spread
among people indulging in sexual intercourse
as among those who are continent.
Acne is often a result of eating too much
sweets and other heavy food. It is treated
by regulation of the diet and local applications.</p>

<p class='c007'>Question 3.—How often can a wet dream
occur without being injurious to health?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—There is no definite dividing
line and exact time limit between normal
and abnormal wet dreams. In sexual life,
individual differences vary more than in
any other function of the human body.
Some men get wet dreams once in 1–2–3
months; some once in 2–3 weeks. The figures
are immaterial. The only safe rule to
measure injuriousness of a wet dream is by
its effect on the general health and spirit.
<i>If a man, after a night emission, feels just as
fresh and strong or even better than before it,
it is normal; if not, it is abnormal.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Question 4.—What may the habit of
masturbation lead to?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Answer.—In a young child (the younger
the more disastrous the results), persistent
masturbation can lead to perfect physical
and nervous exhaustion, and even serious
organic diseases. In older boys and men,
it affects mainly the nervous system and
mentality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Question 5.—Is every discharge from
the urethral canal a sign of venereal disease?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—Not necessarily. It depends
on the character and quality of the discharge.
A white, yellow, or greenish thick
discharge—pus—is always an indication of
a venereal, or at least a genito-urinary disease
(bladder, kidney, etc.), but a clean,
watery, or slimy like white of an egg discharge
may occur in perfect health as a result
of sexual excitement, or it may remain
as a harmless temporary phenomenon, due to
overtreatment of the urethral canal in any
venereal disease. The exact condition, of
course, can be recognized only by a physician
after a careful examination.</p>

<p class='c007'>Question 6.—What can Gonorrhea lead
to if not treated?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—Most common complications
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>of Gonorrhea are: (1) Epididymitis (inflammation
of the testicle), with the possibility
of sterility later on. (2) Chronic
Prostatitis, leading often to nervous weakness
and irritability (Neurasthenia). (3)
Stricture, the most dangerous complication
of all. (4) Gonorrheal Rheumatism, affecting
different joints. (5) Gonorrheal infection
of the eye.</p>

<p class='c007'>Question 7.—Can Gonorrhea turn into
Chancroid or Syphilis?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—No, it cannot. All three diseases
are produced by different germs, and
for this reason none of these diseases can
turn into any other. It may happen, tho,
that a double infection takes place, when
two diseases may coexist.</p>

<p class='c007'>Question 8.—Can chronic Gonorrhea
(Gleet) be cured?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—Unquestionably so, tho in
some neglected or mistreated cases it takes
many months to effect the complete cure.
The only complication of Gonorrhea that
may prove incurable if neglected is a stricture,
yet it can be always improved or
relieved.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>Question 9.—How can a real Gonorrhea
be distinguished from a simple catarrhal
Urethritis?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—The only sure way to differentiate
these two conditions is by finding
Gonococci under the microscope.</p>

<p class='c007'>Question 10.—How long does it take to
cure a Gonorrhea?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—There is no way whatsoever
to predict the exact duration of an individual
case. In average, the cases of <i>acute
Gonorrhea, without any complications, lasts
from 5–6 weeks</i>, and these constitute a very
small minority of all cases of Gonorrhea.
<i>The largest majority of Gonorrhea cases</i> develop
one of the complications and <i>last
from 2–3 months</i>. The <i>cases that turn into
chronic, last from 6–12 months</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Question 11.—How soon can a man who
has been suffering from Gonorrhea marry
without danger of infection to his future
family?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—Not before the physician, after
a most careful and repeated examination
by all known methods and tests, can positively
establish that there are no more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Gonococci present in the patient. All other
symptoms do not bear on the contagiousness
of the case, and contraindicate marriage
only if they affect the general condition
of the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Question 12.—What is the difference
between soft and hard chancres?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—Soft and hard chancres are
produced by different kinds of germs, and
are <i>entirely different diseases</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soft Chancre or <i>Chancroid</i> always remains
a local disease, and leads only to one
complication—to abscess of the glands in
the groin, a Chancroidal bubo.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Hard Chancre</i> is a primary syphilitic sore
and always penetrates into the blood, becoming
a <i>constitutional disease</i>. Syphilitic buboes
are hard and never produce an abscess.</p>

<p class='c007'>Question 13.—Can Syphilis be cured
perfectly?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—Undoubtedly so, tho to be
sure of it, a long time of observation after
treatment is concluded and thoro testing
are necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>Question 14.—How long does the contagious
period of Syphilis last?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Answer.—The most contagious period
of Syphilis is the secondary period, when a
syphilitic has the most active lesions—mucous
patches in the mouth or around the
genital organs.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tumors—gummata of the tertiary
period—are considerably less contagious.</p>

<p class='c007'>Question 15.—How long does it take to
cure Syphilis?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—No case should be declared
cured before <i>at least one year</i> has elapsed,
even tho no active lesions are noticeable.
Most cases take between two and three
years to render their blood free from syphilitic
poison.</p>

<p class='c007'>Question 16.—When can a syphilitic
marry?</p>

<p class='c007'>Answer.—<i>Not before repeated blood tests
have shown a persistent freedom from Syphilitic
poison</i>, which, as pointed out in previous
questions, takes from two to three
years.</p>
